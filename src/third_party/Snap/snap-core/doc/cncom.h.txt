/// GetWccSzCnt
  @param WccSzCnt returns a set of pairs (number of nodes in the component, number of such components)
///

/// GetWccs
  @param CnComV is a vector of connected components. Each component is defined by the IDs of its member nodes.
///

/// GetSccSzCnt
  @param SccSzCnt returns a set of pairs (number of nodes in the component, number of such components)
///

/// GetSccs
  @param CnComV is a vector of connected components. Each component is defined by the IDs of its member nodes.
///  


/// GetMxWcc
  A directed/undirected graph is connected if there exist an undirected path between any pair of nodes.
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)
///

/// GetMxScc
  A directed graph is strongly connected if there exists a directed path from any vertex to any other vertex in the graph.
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component
///


/// GetMxBiCon
  An undirected graph is bi-connected if by removing any single node does not disconnect the graph.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component
///


/// GetBiConSzCnt
  @param SzCntV returns a set of pairs (number of nodes in the bi-component, number of such components)
///

/// GetBiCon
  @param BiCnComV is a vector of bi-connected components. Each component is defined by the IDs of its member nodes.
///

/// GetArtPoints
  Articulation point (or a cut vertex) is any node that when removed increases the number of connected components.
///

/// GetEdgeBridges
  Edge is a bridge if, when removed, increases the number of connected components.
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)
///

/// Get1CnComSzCnt
  We find such components as follows: Find all bridge edges, remove them from the Graph, find largest component K and add back all bridges that do not touch K. Now, find the connected components of this graph.
///

/// Get1CnCom
  We find such components as follows: Find all bridge edges, remove them from the Graph, find largest component K and
  add back all bridges that do not touch K. Now, find the connected components of this graph.
///

/// GetMxBiCon
  An undirected graph is bi-connected if by removing any single node does not disconnect the graph.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component
  @param RenumberNodes if true, then node IDs of the returned graph will not match those of Graph, instead they will have a range 0...N-1.
