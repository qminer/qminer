 | Many of the forms below are quite rare (e.g. "yourselves") but included for
 |  completeness.

           | PRONOUNS FORMS
             | 1st person sing

i              | subject, always in upper case of course

me             | object
my             | possessive adjective
               | the possessive pronoun `mine' is best suppressed, because of the
               | sense of coal-mine etc.

             | 1st person plural
we             | subject

| us           | object
               | care is required here because US = United States. It is usually
               | safe to remove it if it is in lower case.
our            | possessive adjective

 | homonym forms:
