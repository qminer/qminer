    <h1>Storage and stream aggregator example</h1>

    <p>
        These are visual representations of our storage and stream aggregators. In the examples we are using time series, which are
        given to the stores as records, that contain the value and the time of time series.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving average</h2>
    <p>
        Every second we store the values of a brownian motion (to the current value we add a random value taken from the standard
        gaussian distribution and store it).
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we use the <b>moving average</b> stream aggregator, which is connected with the store. By using the stream aggregator,
        we can smooth the graph and get a clearer representation of the values we get. It is useful when we want to see how are the 
        values changing by trying to minimize the noise of the data. Before we could use the stream aggregator, we needed to construct
        the <b>time series window buffer</b> stream aggregator, that is connected to the store. Then we connect the moving average 
        to the time series window buffer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The graphs bellow represent the brownian motion and the smoothen values gained by the moving average stream aggregator.
    </p>

    <div id="statSmooth"></div>
        
    

    <h2>Resampler</h2>
    <p>
        We store the values of the brownian motion and the time intervals are now different. This means that the values are not given
        equitemporial. Now we want to know, what are the values for every second.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is when we use the <b>resampler</b> stream aggregator. It creates new values that are interpolated by using the values from 
        the store. There are three kinds of interpolation: 'previous', 'linear' and 'next'. In this example, we are using the 'linear'
        interpolation. We also set the interval to 1000, which means that we want to get the interpolated values for every second 
        (1000 miliseconds). 
    </p>
    <p>
        The graph bellow represent the brownian motion and the linear resampler values gained by the resampler stream aggregator.
    </p>
    <div id="resampler"></div>
    
    <h2>Merger</h2>
    <p>
        We are now storing two values from the standard gaussian distribution in two different stores, respectively. These values 
        are stored at different time intervals for each store. Now we want to have all these values stored in one store, where 
        every record contains both values of the two stores and the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is when we use the <b>merger</b> stream aggregator. It merges records from the two stores into a new store. We allready 
        constructed the new store, in which we'll store the new records. We have to give the following values to the merger: where to 
        store the merged records, where the timestamp should be saved and which stores (store fields) we want to use for the merger
        and what kind of the interpolation we want to use: 'previous'. 'linear' or 'next'.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The first graph bellow represents the values of the two stores. The second graph represent the values from the merger store.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following graph show the values of the two stores and the values of merger store on the same chart.
