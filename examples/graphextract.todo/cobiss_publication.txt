10000411	Modified pre-curved patellar basket plate, reconstruction of the proper lengthand position of the patellar ligament	Biomechanical properties of basket plate fixation for fracture dislocation in the distal part of the patella were studied on 22 fresh-frozen lower extremities (human cadaveric knees). The patella and the patellar ligament with the proximal tibia were removed. A comminuted fracture of the distal partof the patella was created with a chisel. The fractured patella, patellar ligament and tibial tuberosity of each specimen were fixed with a basket plateand mounted into the jaws of the testing machine. The measured load to failure was 421.66 45.90 N, which is approximately 70% higher than the results in other studies. The results of the measurements verified the resultsof finite element analysis. The modified precurved patellar basket plate developed in this study showed improved performance compared to the pre-existing fixation methods.	gbr	Butterworth-Heinemann	2007	1.01	The knee	1.307	1.197
1000072	Characterization of the mouse lanosterol 14[alfa]-demetylase (CYP51), a new member of the evolutionarily most conserved cytochrome P450 family	Genes encoding sterol 14[alfa]-demethylases in eukaryotes and in Mycobacterium to the CYP51 family which is evolutionary the most conserved gene family within the cytochrome P450 superfamily. We have characterized a new member of this family, the mouse lanosterol 14]alfa]-demethylase, with the aim to study the in vivo role of this gene in spermatogenesis in mammals. The amino acid sequence of mouse Cyp51 is 96% to human. Comparion of all known CYP51 proteins by the neighbor-joining method suggests that fungal and animal CYP51 genes arose from a common ancestral gene (98.3% probability) and interestingly, that plant and bacterial CYP51 genes share a common progenitor (88.8% probability). This suggests that the first CYP51 gene may have arisen in eukaryotes and has been transferred horizontally from plants to Mycobacterium. The mouse CYP51 gene is ~17-kb long and contains 10 exons. Transcription starts at several locations within the CpG island, which is characteristic for the TATA-less housekeeping genes. The mouse 5´-untranslatedregion (800 bp) contains putative cAMP-responsive elements (CRE), sterol regulatory elements (SRE) and GC-boxes at positions similar to human and rat, sugesting an evolutionary conserved mechanism of CYP51 transcriptional regulation in mammals. The mouse Cyp51 gene resides on chromosome 5, region A2, close to the centromere. No signals, outside this region were detected as well as no evidence of processed pseudogenes using long PCR was found. This indicates that the mouse genome most likely lacksCYP51 processed pseudogenes.	usa	Academic Press.	2000	1.01	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	2.576	2.504
10001686	Wet-phase-separation membranes from the polysulfone/N,N-dimethylacetamide/water ternary system: the formation and elements of their structure and properties	Asymmetric and porous polysulfone (PSf) membranes were prepared by wet phase separation. Binary (PSf)/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) solutions with polymer concentrations of 12.5-30 wt % were cast in thicknesses of 80-700 m and immersed in a coagulation bath of pure water. The morphology of the formed membranesæ cross sections consisted of a cellular structure and macrovoidsè the cellular structure density was highest when the cast solution contained about 21 wt % PSf, regardless of the cast thickness. The membranesæ pure waterpermeability decreased as the cast thickness increased. The instantaneousonset of the turbidity, regardless of the PSf content and cast thickness, its steep growth, and relatively high end value were the main characteristics of the turbidity phenomena taking place during the formation of the protomembranes. Again, the membrane-forming system with a PSf/DMA solution with about 21 wt % polymer, regardless of the cast thickness, had thehighest turbidity end value. The shrinkage of the cast solutions into the corresponding protomembrane was also examined quantitatively. Inverse experiments showed that the direction of the gravitation field had no influence on the shrinkage of the membrane-forming ternary system or the membranesæ morphology and its water permeability.	usa	Wiley.	2005	1.01	Journal of applied polymer science	1.072	1.376
10003478	Utilization of bottom ash from the incineration of separated wastes as a cement substitute	Waste incineration is still an essential technology in the concept of integrated waste management. Most of the combustion residues are incinerator bottom ash. It has been discovered that incinerator bottom ash from the incineration of separated waste in the primary chamber of the modular two-stage incinerator mainly consists of metal oxides, especially SiO2 and CaO, in proportions that are quite similar to those in cement and so the feasibility of its application as a substitute for cement in concrete was investigated. It was found that after 28 days, the flexural and compressive strengths of the binder using bottom ash were practically comparable with those of a pure cement mixture. The results show that it is reasonable to use a binder containing incinerator bottom ash for applications in which an early-stage lower strength of concrete element is acceptable.	gbr	International Solid Waste Association	2005	1.01	Waste management & research	0.396	1.081

10005531	Forecasting risks of natural gas consumption in Slovenia	Efficient operation of modern energy distribution systems often requires forecasting future energy demand. This paper proposes a strategy to estimate forecasting risk. The objective of the proposed method is to improve knowledgeabout expected forecasting risk and to estimate the expected cash flow in advance, based on the risk model. The strategy combines an energy demand forecasting model, an economic incentive model and a risk model. Basic guidelines are given for the construction of a forecasting model that combinespast energy consumption data, weather data and weather forecast. The forecasting model is required to estimate expected forecasting errors that arethe basis for forecasting risk estimation. The risk estimation strategy also requires an economic incentive model that describes the influence of forecasting accuracy on the energy distribution systemsæ cash flow. The economic model defines the critical forecasting error levels that most strongly influence cash flow. Based on the forecasting model and the economic model, the development of a risk model is proposed. The risk model is associated with critical forecasting error levels in the context of various influential parameters such as seasonal data, month, day of the week and temperature. The risk model is applicable to estimating the daily forecasting risk based on the influential parameters. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study of a Slovenian natural gas distribution company.	gbr	IPC Science and Technology Press Ltd	2007	1.01	Energy policy	1.901	1.086

In this paper, we will propose the unified mapping of UML model s into function points. The mapping is formally described to enable the automation of the counting procedure. Three estimation levels are defined that correspond to the different abstraction levels of the software system. The level of abstraction influences an estimate's accuracy. Our research, based on a small data set, proved that accuracy increases with each subsequent abstraction level. Changes to the FPA complexity tables for transactional functions will also be proposed in order to better quantify the characteristics of object-oriented software.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2005	1.01	Information and software technology	0.435	0.937
10012950	Analytical travel time models for multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems	Multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems correspond to multiple picking aisles served by a single storage and retrieval machine. These systemsare used in practice when the need for pallet places is high and the throughput capacity is relatively low. Therefore, considerable savings of initial investment costs due to single aisle systems can be achieved using such systems. The objective of the presented study is to develop analytical travel time models for multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems considering the operating characteristics of the storage and retrieval machine. With the proposed analytical travel time models, average travel time of the storage and retrieval machine, from which the performance of multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems can be evaluated is determined. A simulation model of multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems was developed to compare the performances of the proposed analytical travel time models. An example of multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems withfive picking aisles was presented for the evaluation purpose. The results show that proposed analytical travel time models perform satisfactory according to the results of simulation analysis and could be very useful toolsfor designing of multi aisle automated storage and retrieval systems in real-world applications.	nld	IFS Publications	2005	1.01	International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	0.406	0.565

The model is to be used as the boundary condition for one-dimensional wave action techniques and is also capable of considering variable gas properties and composition. The model is based on a simple variable-area approach; however, it is capable of adequately modelling complex flows that occur in multi-cylinder turbocharged engines. This is confirmed through the good agreement between calculated and measured turbine and engine parameters.	gbr	The Institution of Mechanical Engineers	2007	1.01	Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers	0.280	0.73
1002120	Lactobacillus K7 - a new candidate for a probiotic strain	Lactobacillus K7 is an isolate from faeces of a 1 week old breast-fed baby that has been previously found to exhibit bacteriocin-like activity against various species of lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium sp. In this study partial identification of the strain K7 was done and some basic properties that are desirable for probiotic bacteria were studied: resistance to low pH, to bile salts and bacteriocin production. The effect of bacteriocins of the strain K7 against C. perfringens and C. difficile vegetative cells and againstC. tyrobutyricum vegetative cells and spores was also examined. On the basis of morphological characteristics, API 50 CHL (BioMerieux) fermentation pattern and analysis of S-layer, the strain K7 was identified as a member of L. acidophilus DNA homology group B (Johnson et al., 1980). The strain K7 was able to grow in the presence of 0.3 % of bile salts. The cfu/ml during 2 hours incubation at pH 2 was reduced for 2 log units, whilst at pH 3 almost no reduction was observed. Bacteriocins were produced during the logaritmic phase of growth. In flask MRS broth culture and in fermentor with regulated pH (pH=6), the bacteriocin concentration reached 32.000 BA/ml and 160.000 BA/ml, respectively. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of bacteriocins of Lactobacillus K7 for C. tyrobutyricum vegetative cells were 640-2.560 BA/ml, depending on the strain tested. The sensitivity of the spores was higher than of vegetative cells and MIC varied between bacterial strains as well (1.280Þ5.120 BA/ml).	hrv	Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology	2000	1.01	Food technology and biotechnology	0.291	0.734
1002376	Lactoprotein genetic variants in cattle and cheese making ability	Cheese making ability of milk is associated with high contents of protein, casein, (CN) and fat, high casein number, short rennet coagulation time (RCT),high curd firmness (CF) and with a high cheese yield. For the four CN loci, as well as for the beta- lactoglobulin (LG) - and alfa-lactalbumin (LA) locus, more than 60 genetic variants have been observed. However, most of these variants have not yet been investigated with regard to their cheese making ability. In Holstein Frisian cows k-CN BB is associated with a higher protein and casein content of milk than k-CN AA. However, in Simmentals and in Brown Cattle this association is not so clear; a higher fat content of milk seems to be related to beta-LG BB when compared with beta-LG AA. In many publications beta-LG BB also showed a higher casein content than beta-LG AA. All publications referring to the casein number report that milk containing beta-LG BB has an approximately 3 % (absolute) higher casein number than milk containing beta-LG AA. Regarding the genotypes alfa s1-CN BC and CC contradictory results for the RCT and CF values have been published when compared with alfas1-CN BB milk. Beta-CN BB showed in all publications the shortest RCT among all beta-CN genotypes, whereas the reported results for CF of this genotype compared with the types A[up]1A[up]1 or A[up]2A[up]2 are conflicting. From the majority of the published data it may be concluded that milk containig k-CN BB has significantly shorter RCT and higher CF than k-CN AA milk. All rare genotypes at the k-CN locus, such as AC, BC, AE, BE and EE, had worse RCT values than k-CN BB milk. CF of k-cn genotypes increases in the order AE/AA<AB/AB/AC<BC/BB. In most investigations involving Parmiggiano-Reggiano, Cheddar and other cheese varieties higer yields of cheese were found, ranging from 0.3 to 10 %, in favour of k-CN BB compared with k-CN AA. Due to the higher casein number associated with beta-LG BB, higher yields of cheese were reported in literature (range 1 to 10 %) for thisgenotype than for beta-LG AA. In summary, k-CN B and beta-LG B are the most advantageous variants with respect to cheese making ability. However, in most publications attentions was focused on the effects of a single milk protein locus but due to the tight linkage between the casein loci effects of haplotypes should be studied more extensively.	hrv	Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology	2000	1.02	Food technology and biotechnology	0.291	0.734
10024726	Characterisation of grass fibres	The elementary grass fibres were isolated from different grass and legumes sorts, i.e. Ryegrass (Lolium hybridum Gumpenstein), Wheat straw, Trefoil (Trifolium pratense) and Lucerne (Medicago sativa). The fibre-samples were obtained in a bio-refinery, after the liquid phase containing proteins and lactic acid was eliminated from the ensiled and green grasses, respectively. For the isolation of elementary grass fibres different processes were used. The morphological characteristics of stems and leaves of different grass species were microscopically observed. On the microscopical stem and leaves cross-section samples the quantification of fibres sclerenchyma cells was performed. The quantitative analysis was carried out in order to obtain basic quantitative data on grass fibres, such as area of the single fibre or group of fibres, diameter of a single fibre or group of fibres and distances betweenthe most distant and least distant points on the area of the fibre. Measurements were made using a Carl Zeiss software KS 300, which runs on a computer connected to the image analysis equipment consisting of a microscope and a digital camera. In addition to, geometrical and mechanical properties ofisolated fibres and fibre bundles were determined. Due to the grass history,i.e. deformations and damages caused by the treatment of grasses in the bio-refinery, maturity grade, grass or legumes type and conditions during grass growth, the plant structures vary considerable in their properties.	nld	Chapman and Hall	2005	1.01	Journal of Materials Science	0.901	1.429
10025494	Electrokinetic properties of commercial vascular grafts	The surface morphology and chemical composition (the presence or absence of surface functional groups) of commercial vascular graftsæ surfaces are significant for their interaction abilities with components of polar liquids. This can also be assumed as correct for grafts-blood interactions. In this paper we studied the adsorption characteristics of different graftsæ surfaces using an electrokinetic measurement technique. A comparative study was performed on woven, knitted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular grafts. Streaming potential measurements were used for the determination of zeta potential (), which was studied as a function of electrolyte solutionsæ pH and surfactant concentration (using standard cationic surfactants i.e. N-CP-Cl, N-DP-Cl) in order to obtain information about critical charge reversal concentration (CRC). The analysed surface morphology and some physical properties were correlated with the electrokinetic properties of different grafts, and studiedregarding their adsorption characteristics. The SEM images of graft surfaces show that woven PET has more densely packed and more-ordered structure than knitted PET. The PTFE surface exhibits a typical micro-porous structure for a tubular membrane. The strong dependence of zeta potential can be observed from the exposure time to the electrolyte solution. The -pH functions (pH of electrolyte solution) show significant differences between different grafts. Small differences in molecular masses between both surfactants applied cause clear differences in the adsorption behaviours of the arterial grafts.	nld	Elsevier	2006	1.01	Colloids and surfaces	1.611	2.525
10025499	Robust design of flank milling parameters based on grey-Taguchi method	The robust design of flank milling parameters is dealing with the optimization of the cutting loads, milled surface roughness and the material removal rate (MRR) in the machining of an Al-alloy casting plate for injection moulds. The considered flank milling parameters include the coolant employment, number of end mill flutes, cutting speed, feed per tooth, axial depth of cut, and radial depth of cut. Grey-Taguchi method is combining the orthogonal array (OA) design of experiments (DOE) with grey-relational analysis (GRA), which enables the determination of the optimal combination of flank milling parameters for multiple process responses. The basic idea of GRAis to find a grey-relational grade (GRG), which can be used for the optimization conversion from a multi-objective case to a single-objective case. GRG is also used to estimate the parameter effects on the overall performance response.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	0.816	0.656
1002632	Gene technology and milk production	The introduction of gene technology to the practice of animal breeding has opened new venues as we enter the 21st century. Using DNA based genotyping thenew genetic variants of milk protein genes were identified and basic regulatory mechanisms of the lactoprotein gene expression were discovered. Genomic and cDNA sequences for all major lactoprotein genes were deposited in the GenBank and comprehensive analysis of these data revealed the molecular baasis of some quantitative effects which have been reported to be associated with particular genetic variants. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the animal genome enabled chromosomal localization of candidate regions bearing quantitative trait loci with effects on milk traits. The possibility to assessmaternal and paternal in heritance of desired lactoprotein alleles can be utilised for efficient selection of desiredhaplotypes. Beside the possibility to change the milk composition through selection of favourable lactoprotein alleles, there is also the chance to manipulate milk composition via metabolic pathways, which regulate fat and carbohydrate synthesis. Reduction of the amount of saturated fatty acids and lactose in bovine milk are two interesting tasks for the future in order to adapt bovine milk to the requirements of modern human nutrition and to make bovine milk acceptable for special groups of consumers. Finally, the availabiblity of recombinant growth hormone induced new technologies of milk production based on prolonged lactation with high persistance of milk yield.	hrv	Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology	2000	1.02	Food technology and biotechnology	0.291	0.734

10040347	Thickness optimization of circular annular plate at buckling	This work deals with thickness optimization of a circular annular plate at buckling. The plate is loaded with uniform, axially symmetric, in-plane loads on the inner and outer edge. The variable thickness of the plate is approximated by a function of radial coordinates and design variables. An optimization problem is defined to find optimal sets of design variables which/maximize buckling loads at constant weight/volume of the plate. The required buckling loads are determined according to the standard linear buckling equations, and the material is modelled by the small strain J2 flow and deformation theories of plasticity where an elastic linear hardening rheological model is considered. Optimal thickness functions are determined for different support and load cases and the numerical results show that buckling loads can be increased significantly.	gbr	Elsevier	2006	1.01	Thin-walled structures	0.694	0.599

10071324	Demand models for direct mail and periodicals delivery services	This article examines the demand for services of the Slovenian national postal operator for the direct mail and periodicals market and separately for the direct mail market. The main factors of the demand are found to be various price indicators with respect to individual market, two income series and the variable of economic environment. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that the price elasticity of demand on both markets is below zero. The autonomy in price increases is limited due to positive cross-price elasticity of demand for direct mail with regard to price fluctuations for TV commercials. Substitution effects on the direct mail market are even more evident with regard to price fluctuations for advertisements in magazines and daily papers. An additional finding is that the demand on both markets varies seasonally in all models estimated by us. Finally, coefficients of income elasticity of demand for direct mail services show that the total number of mail deliveries on the direct mail market increases faster than the retail revenue in real terms.	gbr	Chapman and Hall	2011	1.01	Applied economics	0.459	1.032

10080283	A beam-deflection probe as a method for optodynamic measurements of cavitation bubble oscillations	High-intensity light from a laser pulse can produce laser-induced breakdown in a liquid followed by a shock wave and the growth of a cavitation bubble. When the bubble reaches its maximum radius, the pressure of the surrounding liquid causes it to collapseè this results in bubble oscillations. The cavitation bubble's oscillations and the corresponding shock waves were measured from the deflections of a laser beam. These deflections were detected using a fast quadrant photodiode, built into the optical probe. The precise relative-positioning system and the small diameter of the beamæs waistmade it possible to detect and analyse the signals from the shock wave and the cavitation bubble. Here, we have demonstrated that a method based on abeam-deflection probe can be used to measure the fast phenomena that follow immediately after laser-induced breakdown as well as the whole dynamics of the bubble oscillations, which corresponds to a three-orders-of-magnitude larger time scale.	gbr	IOP Publishing	2007	1.01	Measurement science & technology	1.297	0.771

The established phenomenological relations enable the solution of this problem, which can be achieved by a variation of the fill height and the water mass-flow rate. The influence of these two parameters was analysed numerically. A 3D numerical simulation of a single-phase turbulent airflow wasperformed. Local values of the air velocity and air temperature were included in the numerical model through source terms. The numerical results present the analysis of local irregularities and their influence on the overall cooling-tower characteristics. Experimental and numerical results for the velocity and temperature fields in a cooling toweræs transverse section are presented, followed by a procedure for reducing irregularities in the cooling toweræs operation. This procedure includes the increase of the fill height and the rearrangement of the local cooling-water mass-flow rate in the cooling toweræs transverse section. In the numerical model these two parameters were modelled by a local modification of the source terms. Modifiedsource terms of the model lead to more uniform aero-thermodynamic properties in the tower and consequently to a higher cooling-tower efficiency. The paper presents a complete diagnostic method of local anomalies, based on the case of a representative Doel-3 cooling tower. The method is based on experimental and numerical modelling of the transport phenomena inside the cooling tower. It makes it possible to increase the efficiency of the cooling toweræs operation. The calculated mean heat-flux density was increased by 2.8% in this particular case.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2007	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.088	0.706
10081819	Comments on the cold metal forming processes stability control	Nowadays different components must be produced in very narrow tolerances, the number of non-satisfying ones is limited to some tens parts per million, the final goal is oriented towards zero-defect production. To fulfil these preconditions the forming processes must be well understood. The paper discusses a possibility to improve and stabilize the quality of products by permanent process stability control and by positioning these processes in stable parts of technological windows. To find optimal solutions a combinationof carefully selected experiments, analysis of successful production cases and tests in the virtual environments is highly recommended. To the discussion on process stability control some examples from sheet metal and bulk metal forming will be presented.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	0.816	0.656
10084123	Load-dependent transition in sliding wear properties of TiCN-WC-Ni cermets	The present investigation aims at evaluating the sliding wear behavior of TiCN-20 wt%Ni cermets, containing varying amounts of WC (5-25 wt%) against 100Cr6 steel at different loads (5, 20, and 50 N). The dominant wear mechanisms were established by using surface topography analysis (Stylus profilometry), scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The steady-state coefficient of friction varies over a wide rangeÈ 0.73-0.27 at different loads for the investigated cermets. The volumetric wear loss of the cermets in general increases with load, while the wear rate varies in the order of 10-7 mm3 (N m)-1. The worn surface characterization reveals that a transition in wear mechanism occurs from abrasion and mild tribo-oxidation at low loads to the formation of a dense tribo-oxide layer, containing oxides of Fe and Ti (essentially Fe9TiO15) at high loads. Efforts have been made to discuss the possible reaction pathways to explain the formation of the tribochemical layer. The addition of WC to TiCN-Ni-based cermets results in increased abrasion at low loads and severe fracture of the tribo-oxide layer at high loads.	usa	American Ceramic Society	2007	1.01	Journal of the American Ceramic Society	1.792	0.62
10086678	An approach to calculate thermodynamic properties of mixtures including Propane, n-Butane, and Isobutane	This paper discusses a mathematical model for computing the thermodynamic properties of propane, n-butane, isobutane, and their mixtures, in the fluid phase using a method based upon statistical chain theory. The constants necessary for computations such as the characteristic temperatures of rotation, electronic state, etc. and the moments of inertia are obtained analytically applying a knowledge of the atomic structure of the molecule. The paper presents a procedure for calculating thermodynamic properties such aspressure, speed of sound, the Joule-Thomson coefficient, compressibility, enthalpy, and thermal expansion coefficient. This paper will discuss, for the first time, the application of statistical chain theory for accurate properties of binary and ternary mixtures including propane, n-butane, and isobutane, in their entire fluid phases. To calculate the thermodynamic properties of Lennard-Jones chains, the Liu-Li-Lu model has been used.

10086939	Coupled elastoplasticity and viscoplasticity under thermomechanical loading	This paper is a contribution to material behaviour modelling. Total strain is decomposed into elastoplastic and viscoplastic strains. Both parts are analysed separately and put together by the principle of superposition. The spring-slider model controlled by either stress or strain enables elastoplasticity modelling under constant or variable temperature with the Prandtl operators. Viscoplasticity is taken into account, if temperature exceeds creep temperature, by adding a nonlinear damper to existing spring-slider models, otherwise just elastoplasticity is considered. The material parameters result from isothermal strain-controlled low cycle fatigue(LCF) tests. Hysteresis loops are assumed to be stabilized. The high speed of computation that is characteristic of Masing and memory rules is retained. Solving of differential equations is not required. The model developed so far is uniaxial, but a multiaxial extension is possible.	gbr	Blackwell Publishing	2007	1.01	Fatigue & fracture of engineering materials & structures	0.726	0.706
10087195	Strain-life approach in thermo-mechanical fatigue evaluation of complex structures	This paper is a contribution to strain-life approach evaluation of thermo-mechanically loaded structures. It takes into consideration the uncoupling of stress and damage evaluation and has the option of importing non-linear or linear stress results from finite element analysis (FEA). The multiaxiality is considered with the signed von Mises method. In the developedDamage Calculation Program (DCP) local temperature-stress-strain behaviour is modelled with an operator of the Prandtl type and damage is estimated by use of the strain-life approach and Skeltonæs energy criterion. Material data were obtained from standard isothermal strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests, with linear parameter interpolation or piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation being used to estimate values at unmeasured temperature points. The model is shown with examples of constant temperature loading and random force-temperature history. Additional research was done regarding the temperature dependency of the Kp used in the Neuber approximate formula for stress-strain estimation from linear FEA results. The proposed model enables computationally fast thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) damage estimations for random load and temperature histories.	gbr	Blackwell Publishing	2007	1.01	Fatigue & fracture of engineering materials & structures	0.726	0.706
10087446	Opportunities to enchance multimode fiber links by application of overfilled launch	This paper investigates possibilities for the practical design of high-performance multimode fibers (MMFs) that can provide bandwidths in excess of 10 GHz km in an overfilled regime of operation. Analysis of standard MMF in an overfilled launch demonstrates that the theoretical bandwidth limitations arise from the influence of cladding on the propagation of the highest order modes. Practical MMF profile designs that overcome this problem are investigated. The standard 50- and 62.5-JLm fiber profiles are redesigned first to allow for the performance in an overfilled launch with the differential mode delays (DMDs) below 0.055 and 0.250 ns/km, respectively. It is shown that such fibers can exhibit the same or better theoretical bandwidth in an overfilled launch when compared to standard fiber under restricted launch. Elimination of the need for the restricted mode launch in high-performance multimode transmission systems can improve reliability issues and can relax the range of tolerance requirements imposed on terminal equipment, optical components, and link installation. Furthermore, MMFs that can be operated in an overfilled launched are compatible with emerging vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VeSEL) wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) array technologies. A successfully controlled higher order mode DMD also allows for the reduction of MMF core size and .d that can be beneficial for low-cost high-performance single-channel links. It is demonstrated that properly designed reduced core fibers can achieve theoretical DMDs in the range of 0.005-{).02 nsIkm. The bend loss properties of redesigned fibers are investigated in detail, showing that the proposed modifications do not lead to significant degradation of bend loss performance. Moreover, they can be manufactured at considerably lower cost while utilizing commercially readily available low-cost VCSELs. Even where the theoretical limit is not achieved by practical fiber making, the reduced core size and .d MMF can provide higher production yield, lower cost, and higher average bandwidth.	gbr	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2005	1.01	Journal of lightwave technology	2.077	0.954
10087958	Data-driven generation of phonetic broad classes, based on phoneme confusion matrix similarity	This paper addresses the topic of defining phonetic broad classes needed during acoustic modeling for speech recognition in the procedure of decision tree based clustering. The usual approach is to use phonetic broad classes which are defined by an expert. This method has some disadvantages, especially in the case of multilingual speech recognition. A new data-driven method is proposed for the generation of phonetic broad classes based on a phoneme confusion matrix. The similarity measure is defined using the number of confusions between the master phoneme and all other phonemes included in the set. This proposed method is compared to the standard approach based on expert knowledge and to the randomly gen era ted broad classes approach. The proposed data-driven method is implicitly evaluated within a speech recognition experiment. The intention of the first evaluation stage is to test the generated acoustic modeIs in a monolingual environment (Slovenian), to show that the proposed method does not contain a multilingual influence. In the second evaluation stage, the generated acoustic model s are tested in a multilingual environment (Slovenian, German and Spanish). All experiments were based on SpeechDat(lI) speech databases. The proposed data-driven method for the generation of phonetic broad classes, based on phoneme confusion matrix, improved speech recognition results when compared to the method based on expert knowledge.	nld	North-Holland	2005	1.01	Speech communication	1.178	0.935
1008975	Apospory in leaf culture of staghorn fern (Platycerium bifurcatum)	The introduction, origin, morphology, and ploidy of aposporous gametophytes produced on juvenile leaves of the fern Platycerium bifurcatum (Cav.) C. Chr. were studied. Leaf explants were grown on modified Murashige and Skoog medium with 0%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, or 2% sucrose. A low surcose concentration (0.01%) and wounding of the adaxial side of the leaf significantly increased the induction of aposporous gametophytes (90% of leaves produced gametophytes). Regeneration began as a proliferation of mainly epiderment cells on both sides of the leaf; subsequent development was similar to that shown by gametophytes originating from spores. Flow cytometric analysis of sporophytes and aposporous gametophytes revealed that both forms had the same ploidy level. On the basis of these findings, we propose a set of conditions which regularly and reproducibly induces apospory on most of the leaf explants of the fern P. bifurcatum	deu	Springer	2002	1.01	Plant cell reports	1.340	1.444
1009001	European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) section of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine	Physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) specialists have an important role in the clinical care of patients during the acute phase of a disabling health condition. This phase is defined as once definitive care or resuscitation has taken place and a patient's need to stay in hospital as an inpatient is primarily for PRM services for rehabilitation. This paper describes 4 options for the delivery of services for people, who continue to require to be inpatients and who will benefit from PRM interventions. These are described, along with their clear benefits during the acute phase of a health condition. The first 2 models are the most effective in making best use of the acute facilities and PRM services. The benefits of dedicated PRM beds appear to outweigh those of the other options and may be cheaper, although no cost-effectiveness studies comparing the first 2 options have yet been undertaken. Prospective trials are required to show this benefit, and a number of examples need to be set up to pilot this in order to provide realistic cost-effectiveness data.	swe	Taylor & Francis	2010	1.02	Journal of rehabilitation medicine	1.967	1.381
10092059	An improved neural computing method for describing the scatter of S-N curves	The reliability evaluation of structural components under random loading is affected by several uncertainties. Proper statistical tools should be used to manage the large amount of causalities and the lack of knowledge on the actualreliability-affecting parameters. For fatigue reliability prediction of a structural component, the probability distribution of material fatigue resistance should be determined, given that the scatter of loading spectra is known and a suitable damage cumulating model is chosen. In the randomness of fatigue resistance of a material, constant amplitude fatigue test results showthat at any stress level the fatigue life is a random variable. In this instance fatigue life is affected by a variety of influential factors, such asstress amplitude, mean stress, notch factor, temperature, etc. Therefore a hybrid neural computing method was proposed for describing the fatigue data trends and the statistical scatter of fatigue life under constant loading conditions for an arbitrary set of influential factors. To support the main idea, two examples are presented. It can be concluded that the improved neuralcomputing method is suitable for describing the fatigue data trends and the scatter of fatigue life under constant loading conditions for an arbitraryset of influential factors, once the optimal neural network is designed and trained.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Limited	2007	1.01	International journal of fatigue	1.117	0.706

By delivering stimulating pulses to groups of three electrodes (GTEa) within the cuff we could define the relative positionsof the particular superficial regions that selectively innervated thetibials anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius muscles (GM). GTEs with and withoutcontractions of the TA and GM muscles were selected and connected to a 4-channel ENG system designed to amplify ENGs by 100,000 times and to pass frequencies between 500 Hz and 10 kHz. In our study, 12 experiments were conducted on three Beagle dogs with a cuff implanted for up to 2 years. We present the results obtained in four experiments conducted on one animal. Withthe implanted leg mounted in a special electronic brace we applied extending forces to the ankle, rotating it by up to 37 degrees according to the neutral position, eliciting torque to stretch the TA muscle. Only the ENG from a GTE eliciting maximum contraction of the TA muscle showed activities corresponding to the trajectory of the mechanical load of the muscle. Next, wedissected the calcanean tendon (CT) of the implanted leg and applied repetitive pull forces to the CT. Only the ENG from the GTE eliciting maximum contraction of the GM muscle was activated in correspondence to the trajectoryof the mechanical load applied on the CT. The results suggest that the cuff, implanted chronically on the sciatic nerve, is useful to record ENGsof the afferent fibres from TA and GM muscles selectively and that the technique could be extended for human use in the field of rehabilitation for paralysis.	jpn	Dr Yas Kuno	2000	1.01	Japanese Journal of Physiology	1.351	2.347

1009619	Intrinsic ionic conductances mediate the spontaneous electrical activity of cultured mouse myotubes	Mouse skeletal myotubes differentiated in vitro exhibited spontaneous contractions associated with electrical activity. The ionic conductances responsible for the origin and modulation of the spontaneous activity were examined using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and measuring [Ca2+]i transients with the Ca2+ indicator, fura 2-AM. Regular spontaneous activity was characterized by single TTX-sensitive action potentials, followed by transient increases in [Ca2+]i. Since the bath-application of Cd2+ (300 M) orNi2+ (50 M) abolished the cell firing, T-type (ICa,T) and L-type (ICa,L) Ca2+ currents were investigated in spontaneously contracting myotubes. The low activation threshold (around -60 mV) and the high density of ICa,T observed in contracting myotubes suggested that ICa,T initiated action potential firing, by bringing cells to the firing threshold. The results also suggested that the activity of ICa,L could sustain the [Ca2+]i transients associated with the action potential, leading to the activation of apamin-sensitive SK-type Ca2+-activated K+ channels and the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following single spikes. In conclusion, an interplay between voltage-dependent inward (Na+ and Ca2+) and outward (SK) conductances is proposed to mediate the spontaneous pacemaker activity in cultured muscle myotubes during the process of myogenesis.	nld	Elsevier	2005	1.01	Biochimica et biophysica acta	4.224	2.996

Oxyl is a strong oxdizing solution generated by the electrolysis of w = 1 % NaCl brine solution from the well of the positive electrode in an electrolysing apparatus. The electron spin resonance (FSR) spin trap technique showed that several free radical species, with high oxidation potential, are present in oxyl solution. Experimental oxidations of industrial wastewater polluted by surfactants, were performed using oxyl (in the laboratory) and industrial scale yielding a COD reduction of up to 70 %. The implementation of wastewater treatment using oxyl in an industrial plant may considerably reduce the water pollution tax that companies are paying for wastewater discharge. An economic feasibility study of the investment was performed, which indicated the good economic potential of the procedure.	hrv	Croatian Society of Chemical Engineers	2005	1.01	Chemical and biochemical engineering quarterly	0.632	0.922

10103068	Economic activity and natural gas as a potential destabilizer of the Slovenian economy	This article empirically investigates whether natural gas has the potential of destabilizing the Slovenian economy. The results confirmed the indirect relation that the increase in gas prices decelerates the dynamics of aggregate domestic consumption, which further decelerates activities in individual industries. An empirical analysis has proven that the natural gas does have the potential of forecasting production trends in individual industries within the Slovenian economy. By using the dynamics of natural gas price movements (and other explanatory variables), we can forecast the dynamics of movements in the production of textiles, leather, fur and clothes, rubber- and plastic-based products, metals, furniture, as well as in the processing industry, recycling, electricity, natural gas, steam and hot water supplies in Slovenia. The obtained results suggest that natural gas price shocks can influence economic activity beyond those explained by direct input cost effects and via the indirect effect of possibly delaying the purchase of goods.	rou	Expert	2009	1.01	Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting	0.620	1.013
10103574	An approach to surface EMG decomposition based on higher-order cumulants	We are addressing a possible approach to the decomposition of surface electromyograms (SEMGs). It is based on higher-order cumulants implemented in a two-step procedure. Firstly, a multivariate version of the w-slice method is applied in order to extract coarse approximations of motor-unit action potentials (MUAPs) out of the measured SEMGs. Secondly, these coarse estimates are refined by modified Newton-Gauss iteration to achieve an optimum fit of the model-based and the observation-based cumulant estimates. All the necessary conditions are derived theoretically and, afterwards, implemented in simulation runs in order to prove the decomposition power of the proposed approach on synthetic SEMGs. The first-norm difference between the original and the decomposed MUAPs, obtained at the signal length of 102400 samples and expressed in percentage of the MUAP amplitude span, yields 5.4% in the noise-free case, 6.0% with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10dB, and 6.5% with a SNR of O dB.	nld	Elsevier	2005	1.01	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	0.788	1.145

In the optimization step pinch analysis and mixed-integer nonlinear programming method are applied.

Therefore, an equation for cost estimation of heat exchangers with areas smaller than 7 m2 was developed and used in the optimization procedure. Using thermodynamic pinch analysis and mathematical programming method, the heat integrated structures were synthesized and compared with the base process flowsheet.

10105366	Building interactive virtual environments for simulated training in medicine using VMRL and Java/JavaScript	Medicine is a difficult thing to learn. Experimenting with real patients should not be the only option; simulation deserves a special attention here. Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) as a tool for building virtual objects and scenes has a good record of educational applications in medicine, especially for static and animated visualisations of body parts and organs. However, to create computer simulations resembling situations in real environments the required level of interactivity and dynamics is difficult to achieve. In the present paper we describe some approaches and techniques which we used to push the limits of the current VRML technology further toward dynamic 3D representation of virtual environments (VEs). Our demonstration is based on the implementation of a virtual baby model, whose vital signs can be controlled from an external Java application. The main contributions of this work are: (a) outline and evaluation of the three-level VRML/ Java implementation of the dynamic virtual environment, (b) proposal for a modified VRML TimeSensor node, which greatly improves the overall control of system performance, and (c) architecture of the prototype distributed virtual environment for training in neonatal resuscitation comprising the interactive virtual newborn, active bedside monitor for vital signs and full 3D representation of the surgery room.	nld	Elsevier	2005	1.01	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	0.788	1.145
10105622	Accuracy of intelligent medical systems	Intelligent medical systems are a special kind of medical software in general, and just as any medical software system they should make accurate presumptions. However, accuracy of intelligent medical systems is highly dependent on various factors such as: choosing an appropriate basic method (i.e. decision trees, neural networks), induction method (i.e. purity measures) and appropriate support methods (i.e. discretization, pruning, boosting). In this paper we present the results of extensive research of the above alternatives on 54 UCI databases and their influence on the accuracy of decision trees, which constitute one of the most desirable forms of intelligent medical systems. We also introduce new hybrid purity measures that on some databases outperform other purity measures. The results presented here show that the selection of the right purity measure with the proper discretization method and application of the boosting method can really make a difference in terms of higher accuracy of induced decision trees. Thereafter choosing the appropriate factors that can increase the accuracy of the induced decision tree is a very demanding and time-consuming task.	nld	Elsevier	2005	1.01	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	0.788	1.145
10105884	The trade deficit and banking sector results in Romania and Bulgaria	We tested for the significance of macroeconomic variables that condition non-performing loan ratios. Our estimates for Bulgaria and Romania support the hypothesis that the growth of available finance might harm banking performance and deteriorate NPL dynamics, most probably due to the overheatingof economies. Since we confirmed that the dynamics of net exports of these economies deteriorated the NPL ratio, the weakening of growth in export-oriented industries could lead to economic contraction with a direct impact on the sustainability of banking-sector results in these countries. Large current account deficits are typical for emerging markets and do not pose a problem as long as they are caused by the importing of capital goods, and, if future export growth is strong enough to reimburse foreign debt. Structural dependence on external financing - which is in part a by-product of the effect of low levels of internal saving - have led to large current account deficits and financial instability.	rou	Editura ASE	2010	1.01	Amfiteatru economic	0.320	1.022
10106646	Enzymatic activity of L-amino acid oxidase from snake venom Crotalus adamanteus in supercritical CO2	L-amino acid oxidase (L-AAO) from snake venom Crotalus adamanteus was successfully tested as a catalyst in supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2). The enzyme activity was measured before and after exposure to supercritical conditions (40°C, 110 bar). It was found that L-AAO activity slightly increased after SC-CO 2 exposure by up to 15%. L-AAO was more stable in supercritical CO 2 than in phosphate buffer under atmospheric pressure, as well as in the enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) experiment. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) oxidation was performed in a batch reactor made of stainless steel that could withstand the pressures of SC-CO2, in which L-amino acid oxidase from C. adamanteus was able to catalyze the reaction of oxidative deamination of L-DOPA in SC-CO2 . For the comparison L-DOPA oxidation was performed in the EMR at 40°C and pressure of 2.5 bar. Productivity expressed as mmol-s of converted L-DOPA after 3h per change of enzyme activity after 3h was the highest in SC-CO 2 (1.474mmolU -1 ), where catalase was present, and the lowest in the EMR (0.457mmolU -1 ).	gbr	Harwood Academic Publishers	2005	1.01	Biocatalysis and biotransformation	1.516	2.284

It is a source of shockwaves that propagate into the surrounding medium. We present a measurement of the source size based on far field detection of the propagatingwaves using a beam deflection probe technique. By taking into consideration the moving breakdown model the relation between the size of the breakdown region and the apparent size of the optodynamic source is shown. An energy dependent enlargement parameter d is introduced which describes the relation.	deu	Springer Internat.	2007	1.01	Applied physics	2.280	1.124
10107670	A multidomain boundary element method for two equation turbulence models	The paper deals with the multidomain Boundary Element Method (BEM) for modelling 2D complex turbulent flow using low Reynolds two equation turbulence models. While the BEM is widely accepted for laminar flow this is the first case, where this method is applied for complex flow problems using ?$k-\epsilon$? turbulence model. The integral boundary domain equations are discretised using mixed boundary elements and a multidomain method also known as subdomain technique. The resulting system matrix is overdetermined, sparse, block banded and solved using fast iterative linear least squares solver. The simulation of turbulent flow over a backward step is in excellent agreement with the finite volume method using the same turbulent model.	nld	Elsevier	2005	1.01	Engineering analysis with boundary elements	0.894	0.597
10108955	A laser probe measurement of cavitation bubble dynamics improved by shock wave detection and compared to shadow photography	High-intensity light from a laser pulse can produce optical breakdown in a liquid, followed by a shock wave and the growth of a cavitation bubble. When the bubble reaches its maximum radius the liquid pressure causes it to collapse, which in turn initiates the growth of another bubble. The oscillations can repeat themselves several times, and a shock wave is emitted after every collapse. In our study the breakdown was induced in distilled water by a Nd:YAG pulsed laser, which was designed for ocular photodisruption.The main focus of our experiments was measurement of the cavitation bubble and the shock waves using an optical probe based on deflections of a laser beam. The applied experimental setup made it possible to carry out one- or two-dimensional scanning of the cavitation bubble based on automatic control of the experiment. Since the beam-deflection probe (BDP) allowed simultaneous measurements of the cavitation bubble and the shock waves, we developed a method for reducing the measurement noise of the BDP scanning. This improvement includes an analysis of the secondary shock waves and leads to a significant reduction in the noise of the measurement. Simultaneous measurements based on shadow photography were used as a comparative method during the experiment.	usa	American Institute of Physics.	2007	1.01	Journal of applied physics	2.171	1.839

10109979	Effect of cooling rate on enthalpy and volume relaxation of polystirene	This paper presents the results of measurements of physical aging on polystyrene with a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn = 1.03). The evolution of the aging process was followed by recording the relaxed enthalpy and the accompanying decrease in volume, using differential scanning calorimetry and mercury-in-glass dilatometry, respectively. The measurements were carried out after cooling the sample at constant rate to the aging temperature. The cooling rate varied between 0.0037 and 1 °Cmin. The aging data were fitted with the KWW and the TNM functions. The differences in the time scales of enthalpy, h, and volume, v, relaxation were relatively small. From the h(v) graphs the derivative dh/dv was found to amount to about 1.8 GPa, a value significantly exceeding the predictions of the thermodynamic model containing an additional internal variable.	nld	North-Holland Publishing Co	2007	1.01	Journal of non-crystalline solids	1.319	0.62

In order to preclude defining the flow direction as aboundary condition, a closed hydraulic system was modelled to investigate theoperating behaviour of the RPS and its energy characteristics. It was shownthat the basic flow direction through the RPS is determined by the level of hydraulic losses within the closed hydraulic system. Combining the closed and open hydraulic system calculations, all possible operating regimes of the analysed RPS are presented by means of 4-quadrant chart.	deu	VDI-Verlag GmbH	2007	1.01	Forschung im Ingenieurwesen	0.157	0.706
10110553	Lifting graph automorphisms by voltage assignments	The problem of lifting graph automorphisms along covering projections is considered in a purely combinatorial setting. The main tools employed are: (1) a systematic use of fundamental grupoid; (2) unification of ordinary, relative and permutation voltage constructions into the concept of a voltage space; (3) various kinds of invariance of voltage spaces relative to automorphism groups; and (4) investigation of geometry of the lifted actions by means of transverzals over a localization set. Some applications of these results to regular maps of surfaces are given. Because of certain natural applications and greater generality, graphs are allowed to have semiedges. This requires careful re-examination of the whole subject and at the same time leads to simplification and generalization of several known results.	gbr	Academic Press	2000	1.01	European journal of combinatorics	0.267	0.495

An approximative formula for determination of the force at immediate post-buckling is given.

10111510	Microstructure analysis of internally oxidized Cu-C composite	On the basis of experimentally obtained data, it was established that submicron-size bubbles are formed by the internal oxidation of Cu-C composite with fine dispersed graphite particles. They are homogeneously distributed in the Cu-matrix. This process starts with the dissolution of oxygen into the metal at the free surfaces, and continues with the diffusion of oxygen atoms into the volume of copper crystal lattice where they react with the graphite particles. The reactions of dissolved oxygen with carbon yield the gas products (CO2, CO), which cannot be dissolved in the crystal lattice of the matrix. The gas molecules, which are enclosed in the space previously occupied by the graphite, have a greater specific volume than the solid graphite. Consequently, compressive stresses arise in the copper matrix around the bubbles. The interaction of these stress fields with gliding dislocations during loading could improve the mechanical properties of the copper. The internal oxidation kinetic in Cu-C composite depends on the diffusion of oxygen in the copper matrix, and the penetration depth of the internal oxidation front indicates the parabolic nature of the process.	hrv	Metalurki fakultet;Hrvatsko metalurko drutvo	2006	1.01	Metalurgija	0.126	0.68

Different non-linear stress/strain relations in tensile and compressive domain are considered. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of geometrical and material non-linearities onthe shape of the deflection curve. The solution of a strongly non-linear setof equations is obtained numerically. In the case when non-linear stress/strain relationship in tensile and compressive domain is identical, an analytical solution is given in terms of infinite series. Several examples fora variety of different shapes of beams are presented considering both linearly and non-linearly elastic materials in the elastic domain.	usa	Technomic Pub.

10112283	A new approach to roughness-induced vibrations on a slider	In the past, roughness effects were included in models by using various friction laws. In contrast, this study deals with simple Poisson impact and Coulomb friction laws on multiple concurrent contacts between geometrically random rough surfaces and their effect on the slider's roughness-induced vibrations. The closed-form solutions derived here relate roughness-induced vibrations to the surface roughness, slider mass, slider load, slider dimensions, relative sliding speed, and the coefficient of restitution. Wear influences were studied by simulating random rough surfaces with multiple concurrent contacts. Contrary to expectations we found that random roughness can induce slider vibrations of distinct frequencies. We found a good agreement between the results of the studied models and the experiments. The closed-form solution was found to be suitable for estimating the roughness-induced vibration frequencies of a hard-disk drive's writing/readinghead and those of a car-brake's pad (known as squeal-noise).	gbr	Academic Press	2007	1.01	Journal of Sound and Vibration	1.024	0.706

The cavitation pocket is longer in the region where thehydrofoil is the shortest. Also the dynamics of cavitation is very distinctive.

10115099	An investigation of the relationship between acoustic emission, vibration, noise and cavitation structures on a Kaplan turbine	The goal of the study was to explain the relationship between different acoustic signals and visual appearance of cavitation. Measurements of acousticemission, vibration, and noise were performed on a Kaplan turbine model, with only two blades, in a cavitating condition. Since a model with only two blades was used, most of the side effects were eliminated, and it was concluded that the cavitation itself is the source of the recorded signal. Results showed an interesting relationship between the extent of the cavitation and the recorded data from sensors. At a decreasing cavitation number, the recorded amplitudes from all measurements first rose, experienced a local maximum, then fell to a local minimum, and finally rose again. The cavitation was also visually observed. It was concluded from the measurements that there are distinct correlations between acoustic emission, vibration, andnoise on one side and the topology, extent, and type of cavitation structures on the other side. A physical explanation for the phenomenon was introduced and included in a semi-empirical model that links the visual appearance of cavitation on the blade of the turbine to the generated noise and vibration.	usa	American Society of Mechanical Engineers	2007	1.01	Journal of fluids engineering	0.571	0.706

10119190	Modeling of impact toughness of cold formed material by genetic programming	In the paper, an approach completely different from the conventional methods for determination of accurate models for the change of properties of cold formed material, is presented. This approach is genetic programming (GP) method which is based on imitation of natural evolution of living organisms. The main characteristic of GP is its non-deterministic way of computing. No assumptions about the form and size of expressions were made in advance, but they were left to the self organization and intelligence of evolutionary process. First, copper alloy rods were cold drawn under different conditions and then impact toughness of cold drawn specimens was determined by Charpy tests. The values of independent variables (effective strain, coefficient of friction) influence the value of the dependent variable, impact toughness. On the basis of training data, different prediction models for impact toughness were developed by GP. Only the best models, gained by genetic programming were presented in the paper. Accuracy of the best models was proved with the testing data set. The comparison between deviation of genetic model results and regression model results concerning the experimental results has showed that genetic models are more precise and more varied then regression models.	nld	Elsevier	2006	1.01	Computational materials science	1.104	1.659
10119195	Free cooling of a building utilizing PCM heat storage integrated into the ventilation system	This article presents a study of the free cooling of a low-energy building using a latent-heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) device integrated into a mechanical ventilation system. The cylindrical LHTES device was filled with spheres of encapsulated RT20 paraffin, a phase-change material (PCM). A numerical model of the LHTES was developed to identify the parameters that have an influence on the LHTES`s thermal response, to determine the optimum phase-change temperature and to form the LHTES`s temperature-response function. The last of these defines the LHTES`s outlet-air temperature for a periodic variation of the inlet ambient-air temperature and the defined operating conditions. The temperature-response function was then integrated into the TRNSYS building thermal response model. Numerical simulations showed that a PCM with a melting temperature between 20 and 22 °C is the most suitable for free cooling in the case of a continental climate. The analyses of the temperatures in a low-energy building showed that free cooling with an LHTES is an effective cooling technique. Suitable thermal comfort conditions in the presented case-study building could be achieved using an LHTES with 6.4kg of PCM per square metre of floor area.	usa	Association for Applied Solar Energy	2007	1.01	Solar energy	1.519	1.073
10119446	Prediction of maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation by non-deterministic modelling	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rhythm disorder. Because of the high recurrence rate of AF after cardioversion and because of potential side effects of electrical cardioversion, it is clinically important to predict persistence of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion before it is attempted. The aim of our study was the development of a mathematical model by""genetic"" programming (GP), a non-deterministic modelling technique, which would predict maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion of persistent AF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with persistent AF lasting more than 48 h, undergoing the first attempt at transthoracic cardioversion were included in this prospective study. Persistence of AF before the cardioversion attempt, amiodarone treatment, left atrial dimension,mean, standard deviation and approximate entropy of ECG R-R intervals were collected. The data of 53 patients were randomly selected from the database and used for GP modelling; the other 44 data sets were used for model testing. RESULTS: In 23 patients sinus rhythm persisted at 3 months. In the other 21 patients sinus rhythm was not achieved or its duration was less than 3 months. The model developed by GP failed to predict maintenance ofsinus rhythm at 3 months in one patient and in six patients falsely predicted maintenance of sinus rhythm. Positive and negative likelihood ratiosof the model for testing data were 4.32 and 0.05, respectively. Using this model 15 of 21 (71.4%) cardioversions not resulting in sinus rhythm at 3 months would have been avoided, whereas 22 of 23 (95.6%) cardioversions resulting in sinus rhythm at 3 months would have been administered. CONCLUSION: This model developed by GP, including clinical data, ECG data from the time-domain and nonlinear dynamics can predict maintenance of sinus rhythm. Further research is needed to explore its utility in the present or anexpanded form.	gbr	W.B. Saunders	2005	1.01	Europace	1.461	2.204

A damage material model, implemented into a commercial finite element program, allows us to monitor the elastic strain, plastic strain increase, stress changes and material damage growth, which are closely related to the number ofload cycles. In this way, the location and the time of occurrence of bearing raceway damage can be determined along with the growth of damage up to the point when a microcrack is formed. In other words, low cycle life of rotational rolling connection can be assessed. The paper presents the material model, numerical analysis of the actual carrying capacity of the rolling contact in single-row ball bearings and the verification of the numerical material model with experimental results of low cycle carrying capacity.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Limited	2007	1.01	International journal of fatigue	1.117	0.706

We evaluated the impact of diesel fuel prices, food prices on the world market, GDP, the bank loans to the private sector, import prices, the earnings of major merchants and the production prices for retail prices of alimentary products. The earnings of major merchants, import prices and GDP growth contributed significantly to the incline of the retail prices in the first period observed. While, the results of the empirical analysis state that the cause of increased incline of the retail prices of alimentary products after May 2007 can be attributed, mostly to the earnings of major merchants, volume of credit, world food prices, the price of diesel fuel and import prices. The impact of producers' prices was insignificant in both periods observed.	svk	Vydavateåstvo Slovenskej akadémie vied	2009	1.01	Ekonomický èasopis	0.237	1.013
10121500	Life cycle assessment of ship-generated waste management of Luka Koper	Sea ports and the related maritime activities (e.g. shipping, shipbuilding, etc.) are one of the main driver of Europe's growth, jobs, competitiveness and prosperity. The continuously growth of shipping sectors has however introduced some environmental concerns, particularly with respect to ship-generated waste management. The port of Koper, one of the major ports on the northern Adriatic Coast, is the focus of this study. In this paper, a lifecycle assessment was performed to identify and quantify the environmental impacts caused by the ship-generated waste management of port of Koper. Carcinogens substance (e.g. dioxins) and inorganic emissions, especially heavy metals, resulted to be the most critical environmental issues, while the fossil fuels consumption is reduced by recovery of ship-generated oils. Moreover, the final treatment of ship waste was found to be critical phase of the management, and the landfill have a significant contribute to the overall environmental load.

10121755	Measurements on rotating blades using IR thermography	This paper presents an experimental and CFD numerical study of convective heattransfer and flow field characteristics in a rotating rotor cascade. Surface temperature distribution on a rotating heated blade was measured by means of infrared thermography, which proved highly advantageous over standard temperature sensors due to its completely non-intrusive nature. The experimental facility, IR thermography method, and the CFD numerical model that was made according to the actual test rig geometry and operating conditions, are described in detail. For the present study, tests were carriedout in an iposonic flow regime at relatively low fluid temperatures, with the Rotational number varied and hot-to-cool air mass flow ratio and Reynolds number kept constant. Experimental and numerical results for the blade pressure side were found to be in good agreement. Analysis of the results focused on the influence of rotation and black paint thermal conductivity on heat transfer through the blade. The results, presented in terms of Nusselt number distribution along the blade midspan, show the influence of rotational number on convective heat transfer. Interpretation of numerical results showed that the black paint coating imposes additional thermal resistance to heat conduction, which can affect temperature distribution on the painted surfaces. With increasing rotational number and all other influential parameters kept constant, heat transfer intensifies, which is reflected in increased Nusselt numbers along the blade midspan.	usa	Elsevier Science Publ.	2007	1.01	ETF science	0.774	0.706
10121756	The perspective of pension system reforms in the new member states	Because of growing awareness of financial needs for public pensions, attention has been focused on privatization of the pension systems. While the privatization of pension funds can encourage development of capital markets in NMS, equity investment in transition economies are even more volatile than in the ""old"" capitalist countries. Privatized pension system coincides with investment risks, higher administrative costs, and inability of private markets to provide retirees with affordable, indexed and certain annuities. Namely, private sector may not provide enough investment projects to efficiently absorb mandated pension savings and the expected pension income is subject to a number of risks: poor and volatile investment returns, longevity, and inflation eroding the purchasing power of pensions. Indeed, the PAYG system appears to be the only viable system to perform well in terms of risk and volatility of returns.	cze	University of Economics	2009	1.01	Prague Economic Papers	0.390	1.022

10128411	Annular shaft kiln for lime burning with kiln gas recirculation	During the operation of certain older types of annular shaft kilns used for lime burning, one may encounter the dilemma of how to operate the kiln at an optimal air excess ratio. Due to excessively high temperatures in the combustion chambers at optimal air excess ratio, the flame must be cooled witha greater amount of relatively cold secondary air. This results in greaterheat loss with the exhaust kiln gas (stack losses), greater fuel consumption and lower kiln efficiency. The effects of increasing air excess ratio during the process of lime burning in an annular shaft kiln are specifically analysed. The paper presents a case of a remodelled annular shaftkiln, in which the air excess ratio can be reduced to its optimal level by recirculation of recuperator waste gas and its injection into the combustion chambers. This also reduces stack losses, while the temperatures inthe combustion chambers remain within the permissible range, which means that the specific energy consumption for lime burning is reduced.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2008	1.01	Applied Thermal Engineering	1.349	0.986

Raw extracts were analysed for contents of major catechins (EC, EGC, ECG, EGCG), caffeine, proanthocyanidins and flavonols (myricetin, caempherol, quercetin). Starting material was found to contain 191 g major catechins/kg material, 36 g caffeinekg material and 5.2 g flavonols/kg material on a dry mass basis. The content of major catechins in green tea extracts varied from approximately 280-580 g/kg dry extract, with extraction efficiencies of major catechins varying from 61% to almost 100%. Content of caffeine in extract was in the range of 75 g/kg, where its extraction efficiency varied from 62% to 76%. Average extraction yield was 30% with exceptions when using pure acetone and acetonitrile, where extraction yield was about 3%. Contents of flavonols and proanthocyanidins were in the ranges 6-20 and 12-19 g/kg, respectively. Different extraction procedures with water were also investigated and optimal conditions determined: maximum achieved extraction efficiency of catechins with water wasobtained at 80 °C after 20 min (97%) and at 95 °C after 10 min of extraction (90%). Degradation of catechins was observed at higher extraction temperatures and with prolonged extraction times. Using a lower ratio of solvent to material, extraction efficiencies were increased by applying a multi-step extraction procedure. Optimal extraction procedure was then performed using decaffeinated green tea leaves, which were obtained by high-pressure extraction with CO2, when 98% of caffeine was selectively isolated without significant impact on valuable catechins.	nld	Applied Science Publishers	2006	1.01	Food chemistry	2.433	1.025
10134555	Liquid crystal transition induced by spherical particles in anisotropic polymer brushes	A change in the structure of a polymer brush formed by chains composed of anisotropic monomers brought about by filling the volume of the system with free spherical particles was studied by means of molecular dynamics simulation. Microphase separation takes place at a certain concentration of spherical particles inside the brush. A microphase that contains a small amount of isotropic particles and is characterized by a high density and high ordering of the monomers is formed near the wall. A disordered microphase witha low monomer density and a high concentration of spherical particles is located at the periphery of the brush. The microphases are separated from one another by a distinct boundary. As the concentration of isotropic particles further increases, the ordered microphase expands until the entire volume of the brush becomes occupied. It was also found that the brush in the ordered state forms different LC structures, namely, smectic or nematic entities at relatively low concentrations or at higher concentrations of spheres, respectively.	gbr	Pergamon.	2007	1.01	Polymer science	0.696	1.528

To reach higher precision of the predicted results, a neural optimization algorithm is developed and presented to ensure simple, fast and efficient optimization of all important turning parameters. The approach is suitable for fast determination of optimum cutting parameters during machining, where there is not enough time for deep analysis.

Because these costs represent a major part of the investment cost for the device, we use it our calculations.	gbr	Pergamon	2006	1.01	Energy Conversion and Management	1.325	0.905
10140505	A continuation method for right definite two-parameter eigenvalue problem	The continuation method has been successfully applied to the classical ?$Ax = \lambda x$? and to the generalized ?$Ax = \lambda Bx$? eigenvalue problem. Shimasaki applied the continuation method to the right definite two-parameter problem, which resulted in a discretization of a two-parameter Sturm-Liouville problem. We show that the continuation method can be used for a general right definite two-parameter problem and we give a sketch of the algorithm. For a local convergent method we use the tensor Rayleigh quotient iteration (TRQI), which is a generalization of the Rayleigh iterative method to two-parameter problems. We show its convergence and compare it with Newton's method and with the generalizede Rayleigh quotient iteration (GRQI), studied by Ji, Jiang, and Lee.	usa	SIAM	2000	1.01	SIAM journal on matrix analysis and applications	1.182	0.664

The specimens fail in the heat-affected zone on the boundary between the main metal and the weld bead in the zone of application of the latter and, especially, near its end. This explained by a higher hardness of the metal in this zone caused by the specific features of the temperature field formed in the process of welding.	usa	Consultants Bureau	2005	1.01	Materials science	0.165	1.429
10142998	Utjecaj konstrukcije preðe s elastanom na relaksacijska svojstva tkanina	In textile materials subjected to the impact of tensile force deformations appear in the form of increased length in the direction of force impact. After relaxation, one part of the deformation disappears immediately due to viscoelasticity, one part disapears with time (elastic deformation retained), while the last part remains as a durable irreversible deformation. The influence of the yarn construction containing elastane on the viscoelatic behaviour of fabrics and their relaxation properties has been studied. The influence of the yarn covered with elastane core on relaxation properties in fabrics as a response to tensile strength has also been considered. The results show an important influence of the elastane yarn construction on relaxation phenomena in fabrics.	hrv	Hrvatski inenjerski savez tekstilaca	2005	1.01	Tekstil	0.161	0.539

Despite several available and well established techniques for process synthesis and integration, very often, changes in process designs are made on the basis of intuition and experiences of engineers. In this paper possibilities of rational energy consumption and energy integration in an existing site for production of specialty chemicals were studied. On the basis of real process parameters and computer simulation results energy integration was re-examined.Total site analysis using modified Site Sink Source Profiles, which gives a profound insight into the site utility system configuration, heating-cooling demands and cogeneration design was performed. The existing site was found to be very well designed. With only few modifications additional 9% of hot utilities and 5% of cold utilities savings are possible.	nld	Elsevier Sequoia	2006	1.01	Chemical engineering and processing	1.129	0.921
10148374	Computational approach to contact fatigue damage initiation analysis of gear teeth flanks	The paper describes a general computational model for the simulation of contact fatigue-damage initiation in the contact area of meshing gears. The model considers the continuum mechanics approach, where the use of homogenous and elastic material is assumed. The stress field in the contact area and the relationship between the cyclic contact loading conditions and observed contact points on the tooth flank are simulated with moving Hertzian contact pressure in the framework of the finite element method analysis. An equivalentmodel of Hertzian contact between two cylinders is used for evaluating contact conditions at the major point of contact of meshing gears. For the purpose of fatigue-damage analysis, the model, which is used for prediction of the number of loading cycles required for initial fatigue damageto appear, is based on the Coffin-Manson relationship between deformations and loading cycles. On the basis of computational results, and with consideration of some particular geometrical and material parameters, theinitiation life of contacting spur gears in regard to contact fatigue damage can be estimated.	gbr	IFS Publications	2007	1.01	International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	0.378	0.656

10152732	Prediction of liver metastases after gastric cancer resection with the use of learning vector quantization neural networks	Objective The aim of our study was to determine whether learning vector quantization neural networks could be used to predict liver metastases after a gastric cancer surgery. Background The prediction of tumor recurrence is invaluable for tailoring specific treatment and follow-up strategies for gastric cancer patients. At present, it is still impossible to make reliable predictions of tumor progression. The use of complex mathematical models such as neural networks has already been implemented for the study of various pathophysiological mechanisms, but to date they have never been used for predicting liver metastases after gastric cancer resection. Methods A total of 213 patients operated for gastric cancer between 1999 and 2005 were included in our study. They were stratified in a model development (140 patients) and validation group (73 patients). With the use of an auxiliary regression network, seven clinicopathological variables were selected to predict liver metastases. Results Forty-one patients developed liver metastases (19.2%). The longest follow-up was 2,754 days. Most liver metastases occurred in the first 799 days after discharge. All predictions were compared to actual recurrences with a two by two contingence table. The determined sensitivity and specificity for the development sample were 71 and 96.1%, respectively. The values for the test sample were 66.7 and 97.1%, respectively. The significance of the model was determined using various post-hoc tests, which all confirmed the effectiveness of our model. Conclusion The presented model exhibited a high negative predictive value and reasonable high sensitivity for liver metastases. To improve sensitivity, the inclusion of more patients and perhaps biological markers is still necessary.	usa	Plenum Pub. Corp.	2010	1.01	Digestive diseases and sciences	2.060	2.834
1015359	Funktionelle Kapazität und Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) im Serum bei Patienten mit Alterspolyarthritis	Objective To compare late onset with adult onset rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Fifty-eight patients with late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) were compared to 117 patients with adult onset rheumatoid arthritis (AORA) with respect to clinical and functional parameters. Furthermore, in 104 patients serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was measured. Results were compared by means of ANOVA and possible influences of age, gender and clinical parameters were evaluated by Spearman rank correlation. Results Except a different distribution in gender (40% males in the LORA group) and a higher ESR, no differences could be found with respect to clinical parameters. However, a significantly higher HAQ score and significantly higher serum-COMP levels could be shown in the LORA group. HAQ scores correlated not only with disease activity parameters (C-reactive protein, disease activity score), but also with the age. Serum-COMP levels did show a correlation with the age as well, but not with disease activity. Conclusion It is concluded that the higher serum-COMP levels in late onset rheumatoid arthritis could be due to concomitant osteoarthritic processes in larger joints, which are not symptomatic. The age dependence of the HAQ score is only weak, but may be the reason why patients with LORA show a worse functional capacity compared to patients with adult onset rheumatoid arthritis.	deu	Steinkopff	2002	1.01	Zeitschrift für Rheumatologie	0.964	2.099

The ultrastructure is most affected in spot necrosis, where the changes are part of apoptotic processes. In the parts of inoculated leaveswithout spot necrosis, a decrease in size of chloroplasts was observed as compared to healthy controls. From the edge to the middle of a spot necrosis, swelling of chloroplasts, loosening of thylakoid structure and changes in optical density of chloroplasts were followed. In the middle of spot necrosis the cytoplasm of the cells was dense, no vacuoles were present in the cells, cells were shrunk, the cell wall was wrinkled and the intracellular spaces were enlarged. An increase in the number of chlornplasts per cell was observed in the green parts of yellow-green leaves as compared tohealthy controls. Secondary infected plants grown in vitro had smaller chloroplasts with exvaginations, but the same volume proportion of thylakoids,starch grains and osmophilic globuli as in chloroplasts of healthy plants.

10164507	An enhanced mathematical model for investigating the dynamic loading of a slewing crane	A fatigue analysis of a structure is nowadays a common part of the design process. One of the fundamental pieces of information for ensuring the high quality of the analysis is details of the dynamic loading of the structure. This information can be provided by means of a simulation using an appropriate mathematical model. In this article, a new mathematical model of a slewing crane is presented on the basis of the experiences gained with a previously developed model. Only the slewing motion that produces the spatial oscillation of the payload is considered, as this motion has received less attention than the translation of the suspension point. The mathematical modeltakes into account the non-linear nature of the swinging motion for largeangles and the non-linearity of the power transmission to ensure sufficient accuracy. The structureæs elasticity and damping, the friction in the main bearing, and the air resistance were also taken into account. The angles of swinging of the payload and the dynamic forces acting on the steel structure of the crane during payload transport were obtained. Measurements onan actual model of a crane were carried out for the purpose of confirmation of the mathematical model. The comparison of the results was executed and a good greement between the predicted and the measured values was observed.	gbr	Mechanical Engineering Publications	2006	1.01	Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers	0.329	0.741
10168584	The visually controlled prey-capture behaviour of the European mantispid Mantispa styriaca	Mantispids (Mantispa styriaca) are predatory insects; on bright sunny days, they wait in ambush for insect prey. The prey is captured as soon as it is within reach by means of lightning-speed strikes with the powerful forelegs. The strikes can take less than 60ms. The mantispid accomplishes this almost as effectively as the larger praying mantis, which occupies a similar habitat, even though the praying mantis has apposition eyes with a high-resolution fovea, whereas the mantispid has unspecialized optical superposition eyes. Mantispa styriaca reacts to an item of prey when the latter covers a critical visual angle. The detection of prey immediately triggers adjustment reactions in the mantispid, which attempts to position the prey item in the visual field of both eyes and in the capture zone. Irrespective of the size of the prey, the capture reaction of the mantispid is always triggered if the distance to the prey falls below a certain critical value. As indicated by the analysis of individual video frames, immediately before an aimed strike, the item of prey is always positioned exactly in the centre of the binocular field of vision in the extended midsagittal plane of the mantispid's head. The strike may be triggered by the ommatidia of the left and right eyes, the lines of sight of which converge precisely on this region. The principal conclusion to be drawn is that the prey-capture behaviour of the mantispid appears to be based on a triangulation mechanism	gbr	Cambridge University Press	2000	1.01	Journal of Experimental Biology	1.989	1.778

10170646	Oil-in-water high internal phase emulsions for porous monolithic polymers	Porous monolithic polymers are objects of many studies recently due to their wide applicability. Especially in separation methods use of monoliths is growing. Usually, porous monoliths are prepared by bulk polymerisation with the use of porogenic solvents. An alternative way of preparation is to polymerise the continuous phase of an emulsion. When the volume fraction of the internal phase exceeds 74%, the emulsion is called a HIPE (high internal phase emulsion), and a polymer derived from it, a PolyHIPE. PolyHIPEs of styrene, vinylbenzyl chloride and acrylate chemistry have been prepared from awater in oil emulsion system, where monomers are dissolved in the organic phase. We describe the reversed procedure, an oil in water high internal phaseemulsion, where monomers are water soluble. Porous polymers based on acrylic acid and crosslinked with methylenebisacrylamide were prepared by using a high internal phase emulsion with toluene as the oil phase.

10171931	Perception of air quality and the thermal environment in offices	People's perception of the thermal environment and the quality of air in mechanically and naturally ventilated office environments is discussed. Interdisciplinary research of the indoor environment (technical and medical fields) was based on the simultaneous measurement of the thermal environment parameters, as well on as on surveying employees during their normal working activities. The survey sought to determine the health status and health problems of those surveyed in the 6 months prior to the study, as well as the current state of health and current subjective evaluation of the thermal environment and air quality. Deviations between the measured values evaluated by predicted mean vote (PMV) - predicted percent of dissatisfied (PPD) model (PMV-PDD) and the subjective evaluations of thermal environment of those surveyed were found. The subjectively stated reasons for the health problems of employees gave precedence to natural, as opposed to mechanical, ventilation, which is confirmed by the average absence from work for health reasons. An index of health was defined and analyzed for the people within a building. Significant correlations between indoor air parameters and the way people felt were found. Findings from the study indicate a significant role for the psychological factors and psychological state of the respondents when subjectively describing the indoor environment.	che	S.

According to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-microspectrophotometry (UMSP) of cambium-adjacent latewood tracheids of affected trees, the secondary wall formation and lignification were completed by the middle of October. In samples taken at the same date from healthy looking silver firs, the S3 and the warty layer were not yet present in cambium-adjacent latewood tracheids. Additionally, their inner S2 showed lower lignin deposition, whereas the compound middle lamella, S1 and outer S2 were distinctly lignified as revealed by TEM and UMSP. It is assumed that these youngest tracheids of healthy trees will later undergo lignification or remain less lignified. From these observations we conclude that the cambial activity at breast height ends later in healthy silver fir trees as compared to declining trees	nld	Rijksherbarium/Hortus botanicus	2003	1.01	IAWA journal	0.667	0.865

This poses great problems, particularly for small and medium-sized companies, which have limited resources in terms of personnel, money, development, production capacities andk nowledge. Therefore, it is very necessary for them to focus on selected areas of business activities where they are likely to develop competitiveness on the world market. Other products or services required to perform their current or anticipated business activities can be procured outside their own organization in the open market. Generally speaking, the technologically developed companies from developed countries in most cases try to find production partners with cheap manpower to perform their activities with lower added value. The organizations from technologically less-developed regions try to find the business partners for the development and transfer of new technologies into practice in their own companies. Of course, for the organizations from developed and less-developed countries and regions there can be several reasons why they try to find business partners outside their own organization. Here, we are concerned with the organizations wanting to develop by constantly innovating in all areas of their business activities. Organizations also face the need to redefine the way they set up their business activities.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients with neurologic symptoms due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection contains specific antibodies and whether the detection of these antibodies can be used for diagnosis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from the cerbrospinal fluid taken from nine patients with central nervous system symptoms on admission to the hospital. In addition, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected cerebrospinal fluid using polymerase chain reaction in four other patients. Antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected using the enzyme immunosorbent assay, indirect immunoperoxidase assay and immunoblotting in cerebrospinal fluid samples from 14 of 19 patients included in the study. The indirect immunoperoxidase assay showed high titers of Mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin G[below]1 (IgG[below]1) and IgM antibodies in cerbrospinal fluidsamples of some patients with meningoencephalitis or meningitis. Titers of specific IgA, IgG[below]2 and IgG [below]3 antibodies were lower, while specific IgG[below]4 was not detectable. Cerebrospinal fluid samples with higher antibody titers also containes IgA, IgG[below]1, IgG[below]2, IgG[below]3 and IgM antibodies that recognized the P1 adhesin (170 kDa protein) of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A comparison of antibopdy titers of concomitant serum/cerbrospinal fluid samples to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and those to measles virus by enzyme immunosorbent assay suggested the intrathecalsynthesis of IgG and IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with acute meningoencephalitis.

10215195	Fluid and kinetic parameters near the plasma-sheath boundary for finite Debye lengths	In a recent paper by Kuhn et al. [Phys. Plasmas 13, 013503 (2006)], it has been demonstrated that in a plasma, the polytropic coefficient is a spatially varying quantity rather than a global constant as usually assumed in fluid theory. Assuming cold ion sources and using the asymptotic two-scale approximation (in which the ratio of the Debye length over the characteristic presheath length, , is set to zero), it was found that the profile exhibits asharp peak (with values roughly between 6 and 8) at the plasma-sheath boundary. In the present paper, it is shown that in a finite approach, this sharp peak is smoothed to a regular maximum, which for increasing (e.g., decreasing plasma density) decreases and finally disappears. In any case, assumptions like =1 and/or =3, which are customarily encountered in the context of fluid approaches, are disproved. Although the present results were obtained for collisionless plasmas, it is reasonable to assume that the behavior uncovered holds qualitatively for any plasma with cold ion sources. In addition to calculating time-independent theoretical solutions by means of an analytic-numerical approach, we primarily employ particle-in-cell (PIC) computer simulations, which intrinsically represent a time-dependent approach.It is confirmed that, although extreme care is required to separate physical from numerical effects, the PIC simulation method is a highly suitable tool also for future investigations of more demanding physical scenarios assuming, e.g., warm ion sources and other more complex aspects thatcannot be treated realistically by analytic-numerical means alone. In addition, the extension from time-independent analytic-numerical calculation to time-dependent simulation permits us also to investigate the effect of collective plasma oscillations on the ion velocity distribution function (VDF). Although the ion VDFs obtained in our PIC simulations visibly differ insome details from the time-independent theoretical ones, the related ion-temperature and profiles turn out to fit their theoretical counterparts very well over significant parameter ranges. Hence, the two methods may to some extent be applied as alternative ones in future investigations on the plasma-sheath transition.	usa	American Institute of Physics	2007	1.01	Physics of plasmas	2.325	1.748

We were interested in the following key aspectsÈ (a) does thd water column function effectively as an æexternal UV B filteræè (b) do aquatic plants need less `internal UV B screeningæ than terrestrial plantsè (c) what role does UV screening play in protecting the various plant groups from UV B damage, such as the formation ofthymine dimersè and (d) since early land æplantsæ (such as the predecessorsof present-day cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses) experienced higher UV B fluxes than higher plants, which evolved later, are primitive aquatic and land organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, mosses) better adapted to present-day levels of UV B than higher plants Furthermore, polychromatic action spectra for the induction of UV screening pigments of aquatic organisms have been determined. This is relevant for translating æphysicalæ radiation measurements of solar UV B into æbiologicalæ and æecologicalæ effects. From the action spectra, radiation amplification factors(RAFs) have been calculated. These action spectra allow us to determineany mitigating or antagonistic effects in the ecosystems and therefore qualify the damage prediction for the ecosystems under study. We summarize and discuss the main results based on three years of research of four European research groups.

1022088	Unravelling the genetic diversity of ruminal bacteria belonging to the CFB phylum	Molecular biology approaches were employed to examine the genetic diversity ofbacteria from Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides (CFB) phylum in the rumen ofcattle. By this means we were able to identify cultured strains that represent some of the larger CFB clusters previously identified only by PCR amplification and sequencing. Complete 16S rDNA sequences were obtained for 16previously isolated rumen strains, including the type strains of Prevotella ruminicola, P. bryantii, P. brevis and P. albensis to represent a wide range of diversity.Phylogenetic analysis of cultured strains revealed the existence of three clusters of ruminal CFB: (i) a cluster of Prevotella strains which have been found only in the rumen, including the two type strains, P. brevis GA33T and P. ruminicola 23T' (ii) Prevotella spp. that cluster with prevotellas from other ecological niches such as the oral cavity and which include the type strains, P. bryantii B14T and P. albensis M384T' (iii) two Bacteroides spp. strains clustering with B. forsythus of oral origin. In orderto establish wheather the cultivated isolates cover the whole range of ruminal CFB genetic diversity, 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified and cloned from DNA extracted from the same rumen samples (one cow in Slovenia, one in Scotland and three in Japan). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes confirmed the exstence of two superclusters of ruminal Prevotella, one exclusively ruminal and the other including non-ruminal species. In the case of ruminal Bacteroides spp., however, phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of three new superclusters, one of which has as yet no cultivable counterpart. Interestingly, these Bacteroides clusters were represented almost exclusively by clone libraries from the Japanese cattle and only three sequences were from European cattle. This study agrees with previous analyses in showing that rumen Prevotella/Bacteroides strains exhibit a remarkable degree of genetic diversity and suggests that different strain groupings may differ greatly in their recovery by cultural methods. Themost important conclusion, however, is that cultured strains can be identified that represent some of the larger clusters previously identified only by PCR amplification and sequencing.	nld	Elsevier	2000	1.01	FEMS microbiology, ecology	2.439	2.225
10223638	Low-speed sensorless control of induction machine	This paper deals with the low speed tracking control improvement of a Linear Synchronous Reluctance Motor (LSRM) drive. An extended nonlinear dynamic LSRM model with magnetic saturation included is used in the advanced non-linear feedback linearization control design and practical realization, in order to improve tracking performances at very low speeds of motion. Iron core saturation is included in the extended model with the experimentally determined flux linkages given as functions of the direct, and quadrature axescurrents. Experimental results show that the proposed feedback linearizing tracking control with the included magnetic saturation behaves considerably better than the one without saturation. It introduces smaller position and speed errors and better drive stiffness.	usa	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2006	1.01	IEEE transactions on industrial electronics	0.590	0.942
10232153	Nonexistence of some antipodal distance-regular graphs of diameter four	We find an inequality involving the eigenvalue of a regular graph; equality holds if and only if the graph is strongly regular. We apply this inequality to the first subconstituents of a distance-regular graph and obtain a simple proof of the fundamental bound for distance-regular graphs, discovered by Juriiæ, Koolen and Terwilliger. Using this we show that for distance-regular graphs with certain intersection arrays, the first subconstituent graphs are strongly regular. From these results we prove the nonexistence of distance-regular graphs associated to 20 feasible intersection arrays from the book Distance-regular graphs by Brouwer, Cohen and Neumaier.	gbr	Academic Press	2000	1.01	European journal of combinatorics	0.267	0.495
10236699	Investigation of a cavitation bubble between a rigid boundary and a free surface	When a high-intensity laser pulse is focused into a liquid the energy is converted into mechanical energy via an optodynamic process. The conversion starts with plasma formation: this is followed by shock-wave propagation and the expansion of a cavitation bubble. A cavitation bubble developed near boundaries results in an asymmetrical collapse, with the generation of a liquid jet during the bubble's rebound. In the case of a free surface this liquid jet is directed away from the surface and the oscillation times are prolonged. On the other hand, in the case of a rigid boundary, the liquid jet is directed toward the boundary and the oscillation times are shortened. We present measurements of a cavitation bubble oscillating between a free surfaceand a rigid boundary using deflections of a laser beam as the optical probe. Shadow photography was used simultaneously as a comparison during the experiments. With the beam-deflection probe we also measured the shortening ofthe oscillation times near a free surface as well as the prolongation of oscillation times near a rigid boundary. In order to explain this shortening of the cavitation-bubble oscillation times near a free surface, Rayleighæs model was extended and compared with our experimental results.	usa	American Institute of Physics.	2007	1.01	Journal of applied physics	2.171	1.839
1024003420	An application of statistical chain theories on thermodynamic properties of hydrocarbon refrigerants	The paper features the mathematical modeling to compute the equilibrium thermodynamic properties in the fluid phase of pure hydrocarbons with the aid of classical thermodynamics and statistical associating chain theories. In the present paper, we calculated thermodynamic properties for methane, ethane, n-butane and propane as the examples of hydocarbon substances. To calculate the thermodynamic properties of real fluid the models on the basis of Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential and statistical associating fluid theory were applied. We developed expressions for semi-theoretical Liu-Li-Lu model (LLL) and purely analytical Tang-Lu (TL) model obtained on the basis of salvation Orestein-Zernike EOS. To calculate the thermodynamic properties of real fluid with the aid of classical thermodynamics, we used Miyamoto-Watanabe(MW) equations developed in terms of Helmhotz energy. We developed the mathematical model for the calculation of all the thermodynamic functions of state for pure hydrocarbons. The analytical results obtained by statistical thermodynamics are compared with the MW model and show relatively good agreement.	nld	Elsevier	2004	1.01	Journal of molecular liquids	1.057	1.912

1024010076	Vibration of beams and rotating shafts under thermal effects	Temperature variations can significantly change the dynamic characteristics of structures. In the presented paper we have studied the clamped isotropic rotor under thermal effects. We have studied aluminium and copper beam. Because the expansion is restrained by the clamping, the beam undergoes internal stresses, which induce changes in dynamic characteristics. We have also expanded and developed Marques and Inman model as well as Bahzad and Bastami model. We have taken into account the compound influence of thermal force, axial force in rotating shaft and gyroscopic effect. The behavior of rotating shaft is studied in the temperature range of 250-700 K. The influence of temperature-dependent material properties was considered primarily with respect to temperature variations. The presented research work demonstrates a very good agreement between experimental data and results from our vibrational model. On the basis of the proposed analytical model it is possible to determine the vibrational characteristics in very wide range of temperatures. The reported paper is the first one in scientific literature to consider collectively the combined influence of temperature, gyroscopic effects and rotor speeds on shaft and beam vibrations.	ltu	Public Institution Vibromechanika.	2009	1.01	Journal of Vibroengineering	0.357	0.969
1024017244	Web-based environment for mechanism simulation integrated with CAD system	The present work describes the architecture of a new approach addressing the sharing of virtual prototypes over the Web with standard programming tools. The usage of standard Web-based technologies leads to easier, effective and more general applications suitable for small and medium size companies with limited resources in that field of research. Designers not only exchange just geometry data, but also more information about design knowledge and design solutions, and collaboration is performed on remote locations. In this work the framework is proposed to model a mechanical product focusing on behavioural criteria. In order to avoid time-consuming virtual model preparation, product variety is defined in single configuration file. The configuration file is covering all the variations, with formalisation of the assembly structure and linking the parts and attributes in uniform way. It enables visualisation of the models from different modelling systems and allows interactive changes and evaluation of the virtual prototype.	usa	Springer	2010	1.01	Engineering with computers	0.625	0.909

1024037468	Phase diagrams for an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game on two-dimensional lattices	The effects of payoffs and noise on the maintenance of cooperative behavior are studied in an evolutionary prisonerâ Ts dilemma game with players located on the sites of different two-dimensional lattices. This system exhibits a phase transition from a mixed state of cooperators and defectors to a homogeneous one where only the defectors remain alive. Using Monte Carlo simulations and the generalized mean-field approximations we have determined the phase boundaries (critical points) separating the two phases on the plane of the temperature (noise) and temptation to choose defection. In the zero temperature limit the cooperation can be sustained only for those connectivity structures where three-site clique percolation occurs.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2005	1.01	Physical review	2.418	1.281
1024037724	Cooperation in the noisy case	We have studied an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with players located on two types of random regular graphs with a degree of 4. The analysis is focused on the effects of payoffs and noise (temperature) on the maintenance of cooperation. When varying the noise level and/or the highest payoff, the system exhibits a second-order phase transition from a mixed state of cooperators and defectors to an absorbing state where only defectors remain alive. For the random regular graph (and Bethe lattice) the behavior of the system is similar to those found previously on the square lattice with nearest neighbor interactions, although the measure of cooperation is enhanced by the absence of loops in the connectivity structure. For low noise the optimal connectivity structure is built up from randomly connected triangles.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2006	1.01	Physical review	2.438	1.237
1024037980	Evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game on Newman-Watts networks	Maintenance of cooperation was studied for a two-strategy evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game where the players are located on a one-dimensional chain and their payoff comes from games with the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. The applied host geometry makes it possible to study the impacts of two conflicting topological features. The evolutionary rule involves some noise affecting the strategy adoptions between the interacting players. Using Monte Carlo simulations and the extended versions of dynamical mean-field theory we determined the phase diagram as a function of noise level and a payoff parameter. The peculiar feature of the diagram is changed significantly when the connectivity structure is extended by extra links as suggested by Newman and Watts.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2008	1.01	Physical review	2.508	1.582

These graphs are originated from lattices by introducing quenched and annealed randomness simultaneously. In the resulting phase diagrams three different stationary states are identified for all structures. The comparison of results on different networks suggests that the value of the clustering coefficient plays an irrelevant role in the emergence of a global oscillating phase. The critical behavior of phase transitions seems to be universal and can be described by the same exponents.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2004	1.01	Physical review	2.352	1.154
1024038492	Cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma with two types of players for increasing number of neighbors	We study a spatial two-strategy (cooperation and defection) prisoner's dilemma game with two types (A and B) of players located on the sites of a square lattice. The evolution of strategy distribution is governed by iterated strategy adoption from a randomly selected neighbor with a probability depending on the payoff difference and also on the type of the neighbor. The strategy adoption probability is reduced by a prefactor (w<1) from the players of type B. We consider the competition between two opposite effects when increasing the number of neighbors (k=4, 8, and 24). Within a range of the portion of influential players (type A) the inhomogeneous activity in strategy transfer yields a relevant increase (dependent on w) in the density of cooperators. The noise dependence of this phenomenon is also discussed by evaluating phase diagrams.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2009	1.01	Physical review	2.400	1.468
1024038748	Phase transitions in the kinetic Ising model with competing dynamics	We study the nonequilibrium phase diagram and critical properties of a two-dimensional kinetic Ising model with competing Glauber and Kawasaki dynamics suggested by Tomé and de Oliveira [Phys. Rev. A 40, 6643 (1989)]. The role of the Kawasaki dynamics, chosen with probability 1-p, is to simulate a permanent energy flux into the system. The theoretical prediction for the phase diagram is improved significantly by using four- and six-point dynamical mean-field approximations. Monte Carlo simulations support that the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition changes from second to first order for sufficiently small p. The antiferromagnetic phase is found to be stable for a nonzero value of p even at T=0.	usa	American Physical Society	2000	1.01	Physical review	2.142	1.005
1024040028	Selection of noise level in strategy adoption for spatial social dilemmas	We studied spatial Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games where both the strategy distribution and the players' individual noise level could evolve to reach higher individual payoff. Players are located on the sites of different two-dimensional lattices and gain their payoff from games with their neighbors by choosing unconditional cooperation or defection. The way of strategy adoption can be characterized by a single K (temperaturelike) parameter describing how strongly adoptions depend on the payoff difference. If we start the system from a random strategy distribution with many different player specific K parameters, the simultaneous evolution of strategies and K parameters drives the system to a final stationary state where only one K value remains. In the coexistence phase of cooperator and defector strategies the surviving K parameter is in good agreement with the noise level that ensures the highest cooperation level if uniform K is supposed for all players. In this paper we give a thorough overview about the properties of this evolutionary process.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2009	1.01	Physical review	2.400	1.468

Monte Carlo simulations are performed on a square lattice while varying the temperature and the strength of cyclic dominance. It is shown that the critical phase transition from the disordered state to the ordered one is destroyed by the cyclic dominance, which yields a self-organizing pattern even at low temperatures. The differences and similarities are discussed between the present model and half-filled, driven lattice gases with repulsive interaction.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2005	1.01	Physical review	2.418	1.281
1024040796	Spreading of families in cyclic predator-prey models	We study the spreading of families in two-dimensional multispecies predator-prey systems, in which species cyclically dominate each other. In each time step randomly chosen individuals invade one of the nearest sites of the square lattice eliminating their prey. Initially all individuals get a family name which will be carried on by their descendants. Monte Carlo simulations show that the systems with several species (N=3,4,5) are asymptotically approaching the behavior of the voter model, i.e., the survival probability of families, the mean size of families, and the mean-square distance of descendants from their ancestor exhibits the same scaling behavior. The scaling behavior of the survival probability of families has a logarithmic correction. In case of the voter model this correction depends on the number of species, while cyclic predator-prey models behave like the voter model with infinite species. It is found that changing the rates of invasions does not change this asymptotic behavior. As an application a three-species system with a fourth-species intruder is also discussed.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2004	1.01	Physical review	2.352	1.154
1024041052	Dynamical mean-field approximation for a pair contact process with a particle source	The one-dimensional pair contact process with a particle source is studied by using dynamical cluster mean-field approximations with sites up to n=12. The results obtained for different levels of approximation become convergent especially for n>-6 and allow us to derive reliable extrapolations to the limit n>[infinity]. At the zero source limit, the critical point exhibits a discontinuity whose magnitude vanishes with 1/n. Coherent anomaly analysis of the data supports the conclusion that the vanishing of the order parameter and the density of isolated particles have the same critical behavior. In contrast to an earlier prediction, the present approximation does not support the existence of critical behavior in the inactive phase where the frozen density of isolated particles depends on the initial state.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2002	1.01	Physical review	2.397	1.073
1024041564	Segregation process and phase transition in cyclic predator-prey models with an even number of species	We study a spatial cyclic predator-prey model with an even number of species (for n=4, 6, and 8) that allows the formation of two defensive alliances consisting of the even and odd label species. The species are distributed on the sites of a square lattice. The evolution of spatial distribution is governed by iteration of two elementary processes on neighboring sites chosen randomly: if the sites are occupied by a predator-prey pair then the predator invades the prey's site; otherwise the species exchange their sites with a probability X. For low X values, a self-organizing pattern is maintained by cyclic invasions. If X exceeds a threshold value, then two types of domain grow up that are formed by the odd and even label species, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations indicate the blocking of this segregation process within a range of X for n=8.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2007	1.01	Physical review	2.483	1.444

1024042332	Self-organizing patterns maintained by competing associations in a six-species predator-prey model	Formation and competition of associations are studied in a six-species ecological model where each species has two predators and two prey. Each site of a square lattice is occupied by an individual belonging to one of the six species. The evolution of the spatial distribution of species is governed by iterated invasions between the neighboring predator-prey pairs with species specific rates and by site exchange between the neutral pairs with a probability X. This dynamical rule yields the formation of five associations composed of two or three species with proper spatiotemporal patterns. For large X a cyclic dominance can occur between the three two-species associations whereas one of the two three-species associations prevails in the whole system for low values of X in the final state. Within an intermediate range of X all the five associations coexist due to the fact that cyclic invasions between the two-species associations reduce their resistance temporarily against the invasion of three-species associations.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2008	1.01	Physical review	2.508	1.582

1024043100	Ordering in spatial evolutionary games for pairwise collective strategy updates	Evolutionary 2*2 games are studied with players located on a square lattice. During the evolution the randomly chosen neighboring players try to maximize their collective income by adopting a random strategy pair with a probability dependent on the difference of their summed payoffs between the final and initial states assuming quenched strategies in their neighborhood. In the case of the anticoordination game this system behaves like an antiferromagnetic kinetic Ising model. Within a wide region of social dilemmas this dynamical rule supports the formation of similar spatial arrangement of the cooperators and defectors ensuring the optimum total payoff if the temptation to choose defection exceeds a threshold value dependent on the sucker's payoff. The comparison of the results with those achieved for pairwise imitation and myopic strategy updates has indicated the relevant advantage of pairwise collective strategy update in the maintenance of cooperation.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2010	1.01	Physical review	2.352	1.29
1024043356	Dynamically generated cyclic dominance in spatial prisoner's dilemma games	We have studied the impact of time-dependent learning capacities of players in the framework of spatial prisoneræs dilemma game. In our model, this capacity of players may decrease or increase in time after strategy adoption according to a steplike function. We investigated both possibilities separately and observed significantly different mechanisms that form the stationary pattern of the system. The time decreasing learning activity helps cooperator domains to recover the possible intrude of defectors hence supports cooperation. In the other case the temporary restrained learning activity generates a cyclic dominance between defector and cooperator strategies, which helps to maintain the diversity of strategies via propagating waves. The results are robust and remain valid by changing payoff values, interaction graphs or functions characterizing time dependence of learning activity. Our observations suggest that dynamically generated mechanisms may offer alternative ways to keep cooperators alive even at very larger temptation to defect.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2010	1.01	Physical review	2.352	1.29
1024043612	Cooperation enhanced by inhomogeneous activity of teaching for evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma games	Evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma games with quenched inhomogeneities in the spatial dynamical rules are considered. The players following one of the two pure strategies (cooperation or defection) are distributed on a two-dimensional lattice. The rate of strategy adoption from randomly chosen neighbors is controlled by the payoff difference and a two-value pre-factor w characterizing the players whom the strategy learned from. The reduced teaching activity of players is distributed randomly with concentrations ? at the beginning and fixed further on. Numerical and analytical calculations are performed to study the concentration of cooperators as a function of w and ? for different noise levels and connectivity structures. Significant increase of cooperation is found within a wide range of parameters for this dynamics.

We have investigated the effect of surface tension on the self-organizing patterns maintained by the cyclic invasions. A geometrical analysis is also developed to study the three-color patterns. These investigations clearly indicate that in the Ævoter modelÆ limit the pattern evolution is governed by the loop creation due to the overhanging during the interfacial roughening. Conversely, in the presence of surface tension the evolution is governed by spiral formation whose geometrical parameters depend on the strength of cyclic dominance.	usa	Published by the American Physical Society through the American Institute of Physics	2002	1.01	Physical review	2.397	1.073

1024044636	Rock-scissors-paper game on regular small-world networks	The spatial rock-scissors-paper game (or cyclic Lotka-Volterra system) is extended to study how the spatiotemporal patterns are affected by the rewired host lattice providing uniform number of neighbours (degree) at each site. On the square lattice this system exhibits a self-organizing pattern with equal concentration of the competing strategies (species). If the quenched background is constructed by substituting random links for the nearest-neighbour bonds of a square lattice then a limit cycle occurs when the portion of random links exceeds a threshold value. This transition can also be observed if the standard link is replaced temporarily by a random one with a probability P at each step of iteration. Above a second threshold value of P the amplitude of global oscillation increases with time and finally the system reaches one of the homogeneous (absorbing) states. In this case the results of Monte Carlo simulations are compared with the predictions of the dynamical cluster technique evaluating all the configuration probabilities on one-, two-, four- and six-site clusters.	gbr	Institute of Physics	2004	1.01	Journal of physics	1.504	1.154

1024066396	The analysis of the impact of particles on cavitation flow development	The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the impact of solid particles on the development of cavitation flow conditions around a hydrofoil. Experimental studies were conducted in a cavitation tunnel with different mixtures of particles and water. The effect of the particles on the development of cavitation flows was modeled by using an additional phase particle dispersion model (Euler-Euler). Numerical modeling was performed using the CFD software. The impact on the cavity model with the parametric analysis of the entry conditions of particles in the calculation domain was investigated, with a focus on the solid shear viscosity. Another purpose of this research was to present the possibility of modeling the development of the vapor phase in the commercial CFD software package, while taking into account the impact of particles. This paper presents the results of the experimental measurements and their comparison with numerical simulations.	usa	American Society of Mechanical Engineers	2011	1.01	Journal of fluids engineering	0.747	1.059

While some of the best resources are found on agricultural lands, the power of the wind varies greatly from one location to another. Professional wind measurement and its accuracy and reliability are thus very important in predicting economic viability before starting a wind farm. Therefore, for the prospective development of a wind turbine, it is important to consider the wind resources, how regularly the wind blows, the direction ofthe wind and the variations in wind speed.	pol	Wydawnictwo Czasopism i Ksiêa¿ek Technicznych ""Sigma""	2011	1.01	Przeglêad Elektrotechniczny	0.244	1.327

1024070484	Prevalence of abdominal obesity in Slovene primary health care attendees - the IDEA study	Background: Obesity is well recognized as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, vascular mortality, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, evidence is accumulating that abdominal obesity is a stronger predictor for these disorders than generalized obesity, defined by elevated body mass index.Reliable estimates of the worldwide prevalence of abdominal obesity are needed to quantify the associated health risk. Methods: The International Day for the Evaluation of Abdominal Obesity (IDEA) study is a large, international, epidemiological cross-sectional study designed to provide reliable data on the distribution of waist circumference according to region, gender, age and socio-economic background. Any non-pregnant patient aged 18-80years who consulted one of the randomly selected primary care physicians on two pre-defined half days was eligible to participate in the study. Results: In Slovenia, 1536 patients were enrolled in the study. The prevalenceof abdominal obesity in Slovene primary health care (PHC) attendees was 33.5% for men and 50.0% for women. The prevalence of abdominal obesity is increasing with age and declining with higher level of education. Abdominal obesity is highly prevalent among unemployed women and former smokers. The prevalence of abdominal obesity is higher among patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and among post-menopausal women, especially among those receiving no hormone replacementtherapy. Conclusion: Waist circumference is easy to measure and mayserve as a single measure to assess the need for weight loss.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2009	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491

In the presented article we have studied the microbeams and nanotubes under thermal effects. Microbeams and nanotubes will be very important in the future in the fields of MEMS and NEMS. For the physical explanation of vibrations of nanotubes classical mechanics is valid with some limitations. We have taken into account the influence of thermal force, axial force in rotating shaft and also gyroscopic effect. The effect of temperature-dependent material properties was considered primarily with respect to the temperature variations. On the basis of our analytical model it is possible to determine the vibrational characteristics in a very wide range of temperatures. In the presented paper it is shown for the first time in scientific literature the combined influence of temperature, gyroscopic effects and rotor speeds on shaft and beam vibrations.	ltu	Public Institution Vibromechanika.	2011	1.01	Journal of Vibroengineering	0.346	1.059

1024082780	Nonlinear vibrational analysis of diesel valve gear	A valve gear system is currently more or less a classical mechanical system in a majority of diesel engines. In our case, diesel engine durability test was carried out incorporating a conventional valve gear. After the 3000-hour engine test, the manifestations of an intensive wear detected on the exhaust side of the valve gear. The wear of the exhaust cam was particularly intensive right under the top. As evident from dynamical analysis and experimental data of the valve gear the loads are excessive mainly on the exhaust cam. The assessment of the minimum oil film thickness at the top of the exhaust cam does not provide any favorable results. As the largest loads are exerted at the top of the cam, where the highest wear was measured, it is necessary to reduce the normal stresses and improve the lubrication properties. Dynamic valve gear analysis was performed in order to estimate cam wear intensity and to compare the new cam designs with the existing ones. The model of the actual valve gear design can be represented by means of the partial differential equations. We used a vibrational system with three degrees of freedom. Partial differential equations were solved by means of finite differences and Runge-Kutta methods. Vibrational analysis allows studying kinematic and dynamic behavior of the nonlinear spring and nonlinearity of the damping forces in the valve gear system. The presented theory will be applied in the future research works for determining the conditions for chaotic behavior of the valve gear system. The dynamic model of the valve gear was used to analyze the causes of the excessive wear. Since the cam, designed in accordance with the polysine curve, offered too few possibilities for an optimum cam profile, we wanted to manufacture a completely new type of cam with more possibilities for an optimum adjustment. At the same time, we attempted to summarize some findings on the dependence of the cam design on the fuel consumption and valve gear noise. Thereby a new MULTICAM cam was developed. Contrary to the conventional theory of polysine cam, the motion in the MULTICAM cam can be written by means of seven curves. The analysis of Hertz pressures provides more favorable results for the MULTICAM cam profile. By using the new cam profile the Hertz pressures were substantially reduced. The top of the cam is subjected to the lowest loads with the MULTICAM curve shape. In spite of a higher contact force the normal stresses are lower mainly due to the higher radius of cam curvature. Dynamic analysis demonstrates that both newly designed cams exhibit lower stresses at the top of the cam and better lubrication properties, whereas the flow geometrical cross-sections and the other control values remain similar for all three cam versions.	ltu	Public Institution Vibromechanika.	2011	1.01	Journal of Vibroengineering	0.346	1.059

1024122964	Suicide victims' last contact with the primary care physician	Background: Previous studies have reported that many suicide victims have had contact with their physicians a week or month prior to their suicide. Aims: To assess the date of the last appointment (and complaint) of suicide victims in the kofja Loka region within Slovenia. Method: We included all suicide victims in the region in the period 1993-2003. Each of the cases was assigned the closest control in terms of age and gender. Medical death certifi cates served as a source of demographic data information and information about suicide method. From personal medical records we obtained the date of the last appointment (and the complaint) with the primary care physician. The same was done for the control group. The groups were compared for their last appointment with their physician (date and complaint). Results: Thirty out of 77 suicide victims visited their physician in the last month before suicide (16/77 in the last week); only 16/77 controls did so before the index day (3/77 in the last week). In 30% of suicide victims, the reason for the last visit was mental health problems (only 3% in the control group). Conclusion: The results emphasize the important role of primary care physicians in suicide prevention.	gbr	Avenue Publishing Co	2010	1.01	International Journal of Social Psychiatry	1.106	2.129

We show that when the feasible set of a quadratic problem consists of orthogonal matrices from Rn*k, then we can transform it into a semidefinite program in matrices oforder kn which has the same optimal value. This opens new possibilities to get good lower bounds for several problems from combinatorial optimization, like the Graph partitioning problem (GPP), the Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) etc. In particular we show how to improve significantly the well-known Donath-Hoffman eigenvalue lower bound for GPP by semidefinite programming. In the last part of the paper we show that the copositive strengthening of the semidefinite lower bounds for GPP and QAP yields the exact values.	nld	Kluwer Academic Publishers	2010	1.01	Journal of global optimization	1.160	0.936
1024151873	Rasch-based high-dimensionality data reduction and class prediction with applications to microarray gene expression data	Class prediction is an important application of microarray gene expression data analysis. The high-dimensionality of microarray data, where number of genes (variables) is very large compared to the number of samples (observations), makes the application of many prediction techniques (e.g., logistic regression, discriminant analysis) difficult. An efficient way to solve this problem is by using dimension reduction statistical techniques. Increasingly used in psychology-related applications, Rasch model (RM) provides an appealing framework for handling high-dimensional microarray data.In this paper, we study the potential of RM-based modeling in dimensionality reduction with binarized microarray gene expression data and investigate its prediction accuracy in the context of class prediction using linear discriminant analysis. Two different publicly available microarray datasets are used to illustrate a general framework of the approach. Performance of the proposed method is assessed by re-randomization scheme using principal component analysis (PCA) as a benchmark method. Our results show that RM-based dimension reduction is as effective as PCA-based dimension reduction. The method is general and can be applied to the other high-dimensional data problems.	gbr	Pergamon	2010	1.01	Expert systems with applications	1.924	1.203

The distribution of mineral wool fibres in the primary layer was determined experimentally using a computer-aided visualization method. The flow properties in the region where the primary layer is formed were analysed.Numerical simulations with experiment-based boundary conditions were performed. The numerically obtained profile of mineral wool thickness at the collection chamber outlet agreed with the results of the experiment. Presented numerical model confirms that the forming of the primary layer is significantly dependent on local aerodynamic characteristic of the airflow in the collection chamber. Interaction between the local anomalies on the forming layer and the corresponding aerodynamic effects in the surrounding region was also analysed.	usa	Elsevier Science Publ.	2007	1.01	ETF science	0.774	0.706

The basic method used inour survey on e-communication of Slovenian public administration with citizens was sending e-mails with relevant questions to general e-mail addresses of the most important public administration and government institutions. Based on the results, we can argue that there was certain progress made in providing quality public service in the area of quality correspondence with citizens in Slovenia. However, more systematic efforts have to be made to improve the situation. This is necessary, especially in case of Slovenian municipalities, which usually have necessary human and technical resources, but they have to be additionally educated in ""electronic literacy"" as well as have an understanding that the public administration rolehas to be changed from self-sufficient organization to public service, enabling people to deal with things other than bureaucratic matters.	usa	M.

Methods: The EUROPEP instrument, consisting of 23 questions was used in both cross-sectional surveys. The first study was performed in 1998 including a sample of 36 family practices and 2160 patients. The second study was conducted in 2004 on a sample of 31 practices and 930 patients. Results: The response rates were 83,8% and 99,6%. Overall, patients' satisfaction has increased from 86,6 to 87,7 points on a 100-point scale (p = 0,034). Improvement is seen in all but four items. Making it easy to tell about their problems was evaluated with same mean score. Involving patients in decisions about their medical care and being able to speak to general practitioner on the telephone were evaluated lower, but non-significant. The only item that shows statistically significant decrease in the mean scores is getting throughto the practice on the phone. By far the lowest satisfaction was reported with waiting in the waiting room in both surveys. The highest scores got in both surveys the confidentiality of medical records, and listening capacity of family doctors. Conclusion: The results of our study provide a clear insight in the trends of satisfaction of family practice visitors in Slovenia. These trends are positive but the results also identified possible areas for quality improvement, such as in the telephone accessibility, management of waiting time in the waiting room and doctor-patient communication skills.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2009	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491

Frucht, J.E. Graver, M.E. Watkins, The groups of the generalized Petersen graphs, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 70 (1971) 211-218]) about arc-transitive strong expansions of ?$K_2$? (also known as the generalized Petersen graphs). In this paper another step is taken further by considering the possible structure of cubic vertex-transitive expansions of general ?$(1,3)$?-multitrees (where vertices with double edges are also allowed); thus the restriction on every leaf to be expanded to a single cycle is dropped.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Discrete Mathematics	0.536	0.716

Methods: All together 197 families were included (father, mother, adolescent -mean age of adolescent was 17.2 years). Rosenberg self - esteem scale, originally constructed semantic differential perceived family climate, Zung depression scale and SASSI-3 (Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory) instrument were applied. Multivariate and univariate approach were applied to verify hypotheses about differences in dependent variables regarding the independent one also with estimated mothers' and fathers' dependency as two covariates. Results: Level of depression was significantly higher, but level of self-esteem and family climate evaluation were significantly lower in dependent adolescents. Fathers of non-dependent adolescents and mothers of dependent adolescents were found more substance dependency vulnerable. Adolescent dependence status differed more frequently in fathers' than in mothers' SASSI-3 sub scores. Conclusions: Results indicate that in group of substance dependent adolescent families with healthier and more engaged fathers participated in the study. Support for mothers' vulnerability and need for fathers' involvement in treatment of dependent adolescent is underlined.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2010	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491
1024227412	Patients' adherence to treatment of diabetes mellitus	Objectives: Diabetes is a chronic disease where patient's ability for self management is very important. Patients are every day taking decisions how to integrate treatment recommendations into their lives without impacting the quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore participants' perceived barriers to adherence to treatment. Methods: A qualitative study with five focus groups of patients with Type 2 diabetes and one group of experts on diabetes mellitus was performed in the central area of Slovenia. The transcribed text was independently analysed by principles of grounded theory with codes merging into themes and categories . Results: Time changes patients' attitudes toward disease. Good education about the disease and their own experience with the disease help patients to adapt to different life situations and to regain control in their life. Family and friends are not always supportive to diabetes treatment. Some patients deny having disease in social encounters because they feel stigmatised. Diabetes also challenges patient's working ability and financial welfare. Patients also emphasise that mutual trust with physician and his true interest in patients' problems is very important for good results of medical care. They refuse universal advice and expect that the doctor helps them to develop self-management skills and coping with the disease. Additional prerequisites for good self management are also adequate organisation of life and adequate personal characteristics of the patients. Discussion: This study offers additional insights into patients' views of the barriers to adherence. Patients feel empowered for occasional departure from recommended treatment in some social and life situations. Better medical care could be the result of good balance between social expectations of the patients, treatment and working demands on one side and individualised support of the physician with patients' own capacity torear range life on the other side.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2010	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491
1024238932	Complexity results for equistable graphs and related classes	The class of equistable graphs is defined by the existence of a cost structureon the vertices such that the maximal stable sets are characterized by their costs. This graph class, not contained in any nontrivial hereditary class, has so far been studied mostly from a structural point of view; characterizations and polynomial time recognition algorithms have been obtained for special cases. We focus on complexity issues for equistable graphs and related classes. We describe a simple pseudo-polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to solve the maximum weight stable set problem along with the weighted independent domination problem in some classes of graphs, including equistable graphs. Our results are obtained within the wider context of Boolean optimization; corresponding hardness results are also provided. More specifically, we show that the above problems are APX-hard for equistable graphs and that it is co-NP-complete to determine whether a given cost function on the vertices of a graph defines an equistable cost structure of that graph.	nld	J.C.

1024247361	Towards the strategies of modern societies	While several sociological theories have traditionally dealt with rational action by human actors, little attention has been devoted to the possibilitiesfor rational steering of the entire subsystems of functionally differentiated modern societies in the context of their increasing complexity.Although rational intentional action is clearly limited at the macro-level by the complexity emphasized by Luhmann's social systems theory, strategies are required to approach the normative ideal of active society as defined by Etzioni. Understanding the strategic processes requires micromacro and agencystructure connections. A possible solution to understanding strategyas a social process in this respect is found in the adaptation of the three-level individuality, reality and totality approach of Sztompka's theory of social becoming.	gbr	Carfax Publishing Company	2010	1.01	Innovation	0.326	0.87

1024258132	Balancing equity and efficiency through health care policies in Slovenia during the period 1990-2008	Background: Slovenia's 1992 health reform set the following five goals: introduction of social health insurance system and a system of co-payment fora range of health care services; introduction of private practice in healthcare; devolution of planning and control functions from the State to professional associations and municipalitie;, and introduction of licensing and recertification for health professionals. Methods: A descriptive and explorative analysis was done of general demographic, economic and health financing data and the reported data on financing structure. The general population health indicators for the observed period are presented. A broad health policy context was assessed through participatory observation during the whole period and using semi-structured interviews with key national healthpolicy-makers in 2001, which served as a mid-term review. Results: Transformation of health care system in Slovenia led to sustainable health care financing at a level of approx. 8.5% of GDP. This result was achieved atthe expense of reduced public funding, which was partially compensated for by the supplementary health insurance and partially by an increase in out-of-pocket expenditures. Private expenditures increased the system's regressivity, which was corrected through risk-equalising schemes and by subsidising supplementary health insurance to the least well off. Conclusions: Slovenia's health care transition took place during a period of economic growth, which afforded stable financing of the system and restricted the capacity of health care providers. This environment had a favourable impact on the general health situation of the population, and thereby reduced pressures on the new system. The previous system was transformed into a mixed social health insurance based system, based on a strong central insurer. The present financing scheme is unlikely to remain sustainable because of demographic trends and other drivers increasing unmet health care needs.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2010	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491
10242587	Buckling of plates with strengthenings	This paper studies the buckling behaviour of simply supported square plates, which have weakening or strengthening bands. The weakening/strengthening bandsare equally spaced and their thickness is either decreased or increased. The analysis assumes that the stress state in the plate before and during the buckling process remains in the elastic range. Two cases of plate loading are studied, one with compressive forces and one with tangential forces. The buckling coefficients are calculated for different numbers and thicknesses of strengtheningweakening bands. The thickness of strengtheningweakening bands and the thickness of the remaining plate is varied so that the volume/weight of the plate remains constant. In one case it is found that the buckling load at constant weight of the plate can be increased by 118% if an optimal ratio of the thickness of strengthening bands and the thickness of the remaining plate is used.	gbr	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Thin-walled structures	0.552	0.617

Methods: The questionnaire comprising 25 statements across nine alcohol policy domains was sent to 320 stakeholders involved in alcohol policyin Slovenia. They were divided into the following four main groups: governmental organisations, public health organisations, non-governmental organisations and alcohol industry. The data collected were analysed using the SPSS programme. Differences between the groups concerning their views on individual alcohol policy interventions were measured using the ANOVA and T-test. Results: Factor analysis of stakeholders' views identified three main alcohol policy platforms: education, regulation and pricing. All the participating stakeholders emphasized education, communication, training and raising public awareness as the most important activities that had the greatest impact on the reduction of alcohol-related harm. Governmental and non-governmental organisations and public health institutions assigned significantly higher scores to the impact of regulatory alcohol policy measures and to the importance of regulatory policies on reducing alcohol-related harm than the alcohol industry. The alcohol industry perceived the pricing measures taken to reduce harm done by alcohol as having a significantly lower impact and lesser importance than did the group of otherstakeholders. Conclusions: Like similar studies of attitudes towards alcohol policy in Europe, our research showed that different stakeholders are guided by different interests in relation to particular alcohol policy measures; however, these differences were lesser than those identified at the EU level. In spite of stakeholders' different interests and views concerning particular alcohol strategies and alcohol policy in general, we have identified common grounds for them to work together to prepare better and more effective measures of alcohol-related harm prevention in Slovenia.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2010	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491

One line of evidence that is emerging as a possible risk factor in the occurrence of VHs is the sleep-wake cycle and sleep behavior in patients with PD. This study compared sleep patterns in a group of visually hallucinating Parkinson'spatients with a group of nonhallucinating PD patients and an age-matched control group. Nocturnal sleep was assessed by actigraphy and diaries, while daytime sleepiness and function were assessed by a battery of self-rating sleep questionnaires. Compared with the control group both patientgroups had more sleep-related problems and significantly altered sleep patterns, as measured by both actigraphy and sleep questionnaires. Patients who hallucinated however slept less than nonhallucinating patients and also had increased awakenings after sleep onset, reduced sleep efficiency, and increased daytime sleepiness. We propose that VHs in some PD patients may be a symptom of poor sleep and prolonged daytime sleepiness, suggesting that arousal may play a role in the genesis of the hallucination phenomenon.	usa	Gordon and Breach.	2010	1.01	International journal of neuroscience	0.818	3.52

Using a mathematical model that incorporates two types of target cells and spatial structuring, we investigate conditions for viral withinhost diversification. We show that branching occurs for a wide range of parameters but that it always requires some spatial structure. Applying our model to the case of HIV, we show that it captures three main properties of the co-receptor switchæ observed in many HIV infections: the initial dominance ofvirus strains that infect CCR5+ cells, the late switch in some (but, importantly, not all) HIV infections and the associated drop in the number of uninfected T-cells. This suggests that the co-receptor switch could result from gradual adaptation of the virus population to target cell heterogeneity. More generally, we argue that evolutionary ecology can help us better understand the course of some infections.	che	Birkhäuser	2010	1.01	Journal of evolutionary biology	3.656	2.52

1024297793	Effects of hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding on postural control or balance in children with cerebral palsy	Aim. This research review and meta-analysis presents an overview of the effects of hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding (THR) on postural control or balance in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Method. To synthesizeprevious research findings, a systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken. Relevant studies were identified by systematic searches of multiple online databases from the inception of the database through to May 2010. Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) quantitative study design, (2) investigation of the effect of hippotherapy or THR on postural control or balance, and (3) the study group comprised childrenand adults with CP. The selected articles were rated for methodological quality. The treatment effect was coded as a dichotomous outcome (positive effect or no effect) and quantified by odds ratio (OR). The pooled treatment effect was calculated using a random-effects model. Meta-regression of the effect size was performed against study covariates, including study size, publication date, and methodological quality score. Results. From 77 identified studies, 10 met the inclusion criteria. Two were excluded because they did not include a comparison group. Therapy was found tobe effective in 76 out of 84 children with CP included in the intervention groups. The comparison groups comprised 89 children: 50 non-disabled and 39 with CP. A positive effect was shown in 21 of the children with CP in the comparison group regardless of the activity undertaken (i.e. physiotherapy, occupational therapy, sitting on a barrel or in an artificial saddle). The pooled effect size estimate was positive (OR 25.41, 95% CI 4.35, 148.53), demonstrating a statistically significant effectiveness of hippotherapy or THRin children with CP (p<0.001). Meta-regression of study characteristics revealed no study-specific factors. Interpretation. The eight studies found that postural control and balance were improved during hippotherapy and THR. Although the generalization of our findings may be restricted by the relatively small sample size, the results clearly demonstrate that riding therapy is indicated to improve postural control and balance in children with CP.	gbr	Heinemann William Medical Books	2011	1.01	Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology	2.918	1.675

1024343873	Dominating biological networks	Proteins are essential macromolecules of life that carry out most cellular processes. Since proteins aggregate to perform function, and since protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks model these aggregations, one wouldexpect to uncover new biology from PPI network topology. Hence, using PPInetworks to predict protein function and role of protein pathways in disease has received attention. A debate remains open about whether network properties of biologically central (BC)'' genes (i.e., their protein products), such as those involved in aging, cancer, infectious diseases, or signaling and drugtargeted pathways, exhibit some topological centrality compared to the rest of the proteins in the human PPI network. To help resolvethis debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its spine'' that connects all other network parts and can thuspass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.	usa	Public Library of Science	2011	1.01	PloS one	4.092	2.115
1024344129	Integrative network alignment reveals large regions of global network similarity in yeast and human	Motivation: High-throughput methods for detecting molecular interactions have produced large sets of biological network data with much more yet to come. Analogous to sequence alignment, efficient and reliable network alignment methods are expected to improve our understanding of biological systems. Unlike sequence alignment, network alignment is computationally intractable. Hence, devising efficient network alignment heuristics is currently a foremostchallenge in computational biology. Results: We introduce a novel network alignment algorithm, called Matching-based Integrative GRAph ALigner (MI-GRAAL), which can integrate any number and type of similarity measures between network nodes (e.g. proteins), including, but not limited to, any topological network similarity measure, sequence similarity, functional similarity and structural similarity. Hence, we resolve the ties in similaritymeasures and find a combination of similarity measures yielding the largest contiguous (i.e. connected) and biologically sound alignments. MI-GRAAL exposes the largest functional, connected regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network similarity to date: surprisingly, it reveals that 77.7% of proteins in the baker's yeast high-confidence PPI network participatein such a subnetwork that is fully contained in the human highconfidence PPI network. This is the first demonstration that species as diverse as yeast and human contain so large, continuous regions of global network similarity. We apply MI-GRAAL's alignments to predict functions of un-annotated proteins in yeast, human and bacteria validating our predictions in the literature. Furthermore, using network alignment scores for PPI networks of different herpes viruses, we reconstruct their phylogenetic relationship. This is the first time that phylogeny is exactly reconstructed from purely topological alignments of PPI networks.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2011	1.01	Bioinformatics	5.468	1.811
1024344385	GraphCrunch 2	Background: Recent advancements in experimental biotechnology have produced large amounts of proteinprotein interaction (PPI) data. The topology of PPI networks is believed to have a strong link to their function. Hence, the abundance of PPI data for many organisms stimulates the development of computational techniques for the modeling, comparison, alignment, and clustering of networks. In addition, finding representative models for PPI networks will improve our understanding of the cell just as a model of gravityhas helped us understand planetary motion. To decide if a model is representative, we need quantitative comparisons of model networks to real ones. However, exact network comparison is computationally intractable and therefore several heuristics have been used instead. Some of these heuristics are easily computable network properties, such as the degree distribution, or the clustering coefficient. An important special case of network comparisonis the network alignment problem. Analogous to sequence alignment, this problem asks to find the best mapping between regions in two networks. It is expected that network alignment might have as strong an impact on our understanding of biology as sequence alignment has had. Topology-based clustering of nodes in PPI networks is another example of an important networkanalysis problem that can uncover relationships between interaction patterns and phenotype. Results: We introduce the GraphCrunch 2 software tool,which addresses these problems. It is a significant extension of GraphCrunch which implements the most popular random network models and compares them with the data networks with respect to many network properties. Also, GraphCrunch 2 implements the GRAph ALigner algorithm (""GRAAL) for purely topological network alignment. GRAAL can align any pair of networks andexposes large, dense, contiguous regions of topological and functional similarities far larger than any other existing tool. Finally, GraphCruch 2 implements an algorithm for clustering nodes within a network based solely on their topological similarities. Using GraphCrunch 2, we demonstrate that eukaryotic and viral PPI networks may belong to different graph model familiesand show that topology-based clustering can reveal important functional similarities between proteins within yeast and human PPI networks. Conclusions: GraphCrunch 2 is a software tool that implements the latest research on biological network analysis. It parallelizes computationally intensive tasks to fully utilize the potential of modern multi-core CPUs. It is opensource and freely available for research use. It runs under the Windowsand Linux platforms.	gbr	BioMed Central	2011	1.01	BMC bioinformatics	2.751	1.811
1024345153	Protein interaction network topology uncovers melanogenesis regulatory network components within functional genomics datasets	Abstract Background: RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)-based functional genomics is a systems-level approach to identify novel genes that control biological phenotypes. Existing computational approaches can identify individual genes from RNAi datasets that regulate a given biological process. However, currently available methods cannot identify which RNAi screen ""hits"" are novel components of well-characterized biological pathways known to regulate the interrogated phenotype. In this study, we describe a method to identify genes from RNAi datasets that are novel components of known biological pathways. We experimentally validate our approach in the context ofa recently completed RNAi screen to identify novel regulators of melanogenesis. Results: In this study, we utilize a PPI network topology-basedapproach to identify targets within our RNAi dataset that may becomponents of known melanogenesis regulatory pathways. Our computational approach identifies a set of screen targets that cluster topologically in a human PPI network with the known pigment regulator Endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB). Validation studies reveal that these genes impact pigment production and EDNRB signaling in pigmented melanoma cells (MNT-1) and normal melanocytes. Conclusions: We present an approach that identifies novel components of well-characterized biological pathways from functional genomics datasets that could not have been identified by existing statistical and computational approaches.	gbr	BioMed Central	2010	1.01	BMC systems biology	3.565	1.868
1024345409	Geometric de-noising of protein-protein interaction networks	Understanding complex networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is one of the foremost challenges of the postgenomic era. Due to the recent advances in experimental bio-technology, including yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H), tandem affinity purification (TAP) and other high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) detection, huge amounts of PPI network data are becoming available. Of major concern, however, are the levels of noise andincompleteness. For example, for Y2H screens, it is thought that the false positive rate could be as high as 64%, and the false negative rate may range from 43% to 71%. TAP experiments are believed to have comparable levels of noise. We present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks obtained from experimental studies. We use it forpredicting new interactions and thus for guiding future biological experiments. This technique is the first to utilize currently the best fittingnetwork model for PPI networks, geometric graphs. Our approach achievesspecificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. We use it to assign confidence scores to physical protein-protein interactions in the human PPI network downloaded from BioGRID. Using our approach, we predict 251 interactions in the human PPI network, a statistically significant fraction ofwhich correspond to protein pairs sharing common GO terms. Moreover, we validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID.

1024345665	Topological network alignment uncovers biological function and phylogeny	Sequence comparison and alignment has had an enormous impact on our understanding of evolution, biology and disease. Comparison and alignment of biological networks will probably have a similar impact. Existing network alignments use information external to the networks, such as sequence, becauseno good algorithm for purely topological alignment has yet been devised. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm based solely on network topology, that can be used to align any two networks. We apply it to biological networks to produce by far the most complete topological alignmentsof biological networks to date. We demonstrate that both species phylogeny and detailed biological function of individual proteins can be extracted from our alignments. Topology-based alignments have the potential toprovide a completely new, independent source of phylogenetic information. Our alignment of the protein-protein interaction networks of two very different speciesyeast and humanindicate that even distant species share a surprising amount of network topology, suggesting broad similarities in internal cellular wiring across all life on Earth.	gbr	The Royal Society	2010	1.01	Journal of the Royal Society interface	4.259	2.124

Cell cycle transitions between different phases are tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is characteristic of cancer cells. To understand cell cycle phase specific regulation of the 26S proteasome and reveal the molecularmechanisms underlying the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway during cell cycle progression, we have carried out comprehensive characterization of cell cycle phase specific proteasome interacting proteins (PIPs) by QTAX analysis of synchronized yeast cells. Our efforts have generated specific proteasome interaction networks for the G1, S, and M phasesof the cell cycle and identified a total of 677 PIPs, 266 of which were not previously identified from unsynchronized cells. On the basis of the dynamic changes of their SILAC ratios across the three cell cycle phases, we have employed a profile vector-based clustering approach and identified 20 functionally significant groups of PIPs, 3 of which are enriched with cell cycle related functions. This work presents the first step toward understanding how dynamic proteasome interactions are involved in various cellular pathways during the cell cycle.	usa	American Chemical Society	2010	1.01	Journal of proteome research	5.460	3.135
1024347201	Systems-level cancer gene identification from protein interaction network topology applied to melanogenesis-related functional genomics data	Many real-world phenomena have been described in terms of large networks. Networks have been invaluable models for the understanding of biological systems. Since proteins carry out most biological processes, we focus on analysing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Proteins interact to perform a function. Thus, PPI networks reflect the interconnected nature of biological processes and analysing their structural properties could provide insights into biological function and disease. We have already demonstrated, by using a sensitive graph theoretic method for comparing topologies of node neighbourhoods called graphlet degree signatures', that proteins with similarsurroundings in PPI networks tend to perform the same functions. Here, we explore whether the involvement of genes in cancer suggests the similarity of their topological signatures' as well. By applying a series of clustering methods to proteins' topological signature similarities, we demonstrate that the obtained clusters are significantly enriched with cancer genes. We apply this methodology to identify novel cancer gene candidates, validating 80 per cent of our predictions in the literature. We also validate predictions biologically by identifying cancer-related negative regulators of melanogenesis identified in our siRNA screen. This is encouraging, since we have done this solely from PPI network topology. We provide clear evidence that PPI network structure around cancer genes is different from the structurearound non-cancer genes. Understanding the underlying principles of this phenomenon is an open question, with a potential for increasing our understanding of complex diseases.	gbr	The Royal Society	2009	1.01	Journal of the Royal Society interface	4.241	2.33
1024347713	Optimized null model for protein structure networks	Much attention has recently been given to the statistical significance of topological features observed in biological networks. Here, we consider residue interaction graphs (RIGs) as network representations of protein structures with residues as nodes and inter-residue interactions as edges. Degree-preserving randomized models have been widely used for this purpose in biomolecular networks. However, such a single summary statistic of a network may not be detailed enough to capture the complex topological characteristics of protein structures and their network counterparts. Here, we investigate a variety of topological properties of RIGs to find a well fitting network null model for them. The RIGs are derived from a structurally diverse protein data set at various distance cut-offs and for different groups of interacting atoms. We compare the network structure of RIGs to several random graph models. We show that 3-dimensional geometric random graphs, that model spatialrelationships between objects, provide the best fit to RIGs. We investigate the relationship between the strength of the fit and various protein structural features. We show that the fit depends on protein size, structural class, and thermostability, but not on quaternary structure. We apply our model to the identification of significantly over-represented structural building blocks, i.e., network motifs, in protein structure networks. As expected, choosing geometric graphs as a null model results in the most specific identification of motifs. Our geometric random graph model may facilitate further graph-based studies of protein conformation space and have important implications for protein structure comparison and prediction. The choice of a well-fitting null model is crucial for finding structural motifs that play an important role in protein folding, stability and function.To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the challenge of finding an optimized null model for RIGs, by comparing various RIG definitions against a series of network models.	usa	Public Library of Science	2009	1.01	PloS one	4.351	2.031
1024348481	Fitting a geometric graph to a protein-protein interaction network	Motivation: Finding a good network null model for protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is a fundamental issue. Such a model would provide insights into the interplay between network structure and biological function as well as into evolution. Also, network (graph) models are used to guide biological experiments and discover new biological features. It has been proposed that geometric random graphs are a good model for PPI networks. In a geometric random graph, nodes correspond to uniformly randomly distributed points in a metric space and edges (links) exist between pairs of nodes for which the corresponding points in the metric space are close enough according to some distance norm. Computational experiments have revealed close matches between key topological properties of PPI networks and geometric random graph models. In this work, we push the comparison further by exploiting the fact that the geometric property can be tested for directly. To this end, we develop an algorithm that takes PPI interaction data and embeds proteins into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, under the premise that connectivity information corresponds to Euclidean proximity, as in geometric-random graphs.We judge the sensitivity and specificity of the fit by computing the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve. The network embedding algorithm is based on multi-dimensional scaling, with the square root of the path length in a network playing the role of the Euclidean distance in the Euclidean space. The algorithm exploits sparsity for computational efficiency, and requires only a few sparse matrix multiplications, giving a complexity of O(N2) where N is the number of proteins. Results: The algorithm has been verified in the sense that it successfully rediscovers the geometric structure in artificially constructed geometric networks, even when noise is added by re-wiring some links. Applyingthe algorithm to 19 publicly available PPI networks of various organisms indicated that: (a) geometric effects are present and (b) two-dimensional Euclidean space is generally as effective as higher dimensional Euclidean space for explaining the connectivity. Testing on a high-confidence yeast data set produced a very strong indication of geometric structure (area under the ROC curve of 0.89), with this network being essentially indistinguishable from a noisy geometric network. Overall, the results add support to the hypothesis that PPI networks have a geometric structure.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2008	1.01	Bioinformatics	4.328	2.069
1024348737	GraphCrunch	Background: The recent explosion in biological and other real-world network data has created the need for improved tools for large network analyses. In addition to well established global network properties, several new mathematical techniques for analyzing local structural properties of large networks have been developed. Small over-represented subgraphs, called networkmotifs, have been introduced to identify simple building blocks of complex networks. Small induced subgraphs, called graphlets, have been used todevelop network signatures that summarize network topologies. Based on these network signatures, two new highly sensitive measures of network local structural similarities were designed: the relative graphlet frequency distance (RGF-distance) and the graphlet degree distribution agreement (GDD-agreement). Finding adequate null-models for biological networks is important in many research domains. Network properties are used to assess the fit of network models to the data. Various network models have been proposed. To date, there does not exist a software tool that measures the above mentioned local network properties. Moreover, none of the existing tools compare real-world networks against a series of network models with respect tothese local as well as a multitude of global network properties. Results: Thus, we introduce GraphCrunch, a software tool that finds well-fitting network models by comparing large real-world networks against random graph models according to various network structural similarity measures. It has unique capabilities of finding computationally expensive RGF-distance and GDD-agreement measures. In addition, it computes several standard global network measures and thus supports the largest variety of network measures thus far. Also, it is the first software tool that compares real-world networks against a series of network models and that has built-in parallel computing capabilities allowing for a user specified list of machines on whichto perform compute intensive searches for local network properties. Furthermore, GraphCrunch is easily extendible to include additional network measures and models. Conclusions: GraphCrunch is a software tool that implements the latest research on biological network models and properties: itcompares real-world networks against a series of random graph models with respect to a multitude of local and global network properties. We present GraphCrunch as a comprehensive, parallelizable, and easily extendible softwaretool for analyzing and modeling large biological networks. The software is open-source and freely available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bio-nets/graphcrunch/. It runs under Linux, MacOS, andWindows Cygwin. In addition, it has an easy to use on-line web user interface that is available from the above web page.	gbr	BioMed Central	2008	1.01	BMC bioinformatics	3.781	2.069
1024348993	Not all scale-free networks are born equal	The interactions among proteins in an organism can be represented as a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, where each protein is represented with a node, and each interaction is represented with an edge between two nodes. As PPI networks of several model organisms become available, their topological features attract considerable attention. It is believed that the available PPI networks are (1) small-world'' networks, and (2) their degree distribution is in the form of a power law.'' In other words, (1) it is possible to reach from a protein to any other protein in only a small (approximately six) number of hops, and (2) although most proteins have only afew interactions (one or two), there are a few proteins with many more interactions (200 or more) and that act as hubs.'' It has thus been temptingto develop simple mathematical network generators with topological features similar to those of the available PPI networks. One such model, the duplication model,'' is based on Ohno's model of genome growth. It starts with a small seed network'' and grows by duplicating'' one of the existingnodes at a time, with an identical set of interactions; a randomly selected subset of these interactions is then deleted, and a few new interactions are added at random. It has been mathematically proven that the duplication model provides a small-world network and also has a power-law degree distribution. What we show in this paper is that by choosing the right'' seed network, many other topological features of the available PPI networks can be captured by the duplication model. The right seed network in this case turns out to include two sizable cliques'' (subnetworks where all node pairs are connected) with many interactions in between. In this paper, wealso consider the preferential attachment model, which again grows by addingto a seed network one node at a time and connecting the new node to every other node with probability proportional to the existing degree of the second node. Because the preferential attachment model also provides a small-world network and has a power-law degree distribution, it has been considered equivalent to the duplication model. We show that the two models are vastly different in terms of other topological features we consider, and the preferential attachment model cannot capture some key features of the available PPI networks.	usa	Public Library of Science	2007	1.01	PLoS computational biology	6.236	1.826
1024349249	Biological network comparison using graphlet degree distribution	Motivation: Analogous to biological sequence comparison, comparing cellular networks is an important problem that could provide insight into biological understanding and therapeutics. For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar. Results: We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In particular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of nodes touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure consists of 73 graphlet degree distributions of graphlets with 2-5 nodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e. graphlets), if necessary, and the extensions are limited only by the available CPU. Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 graphlet degree distributions into a network agreement' measure which is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that networks have identical distributions and 0 means that they are far apart. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that almost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, resulting from various high-throughput experimental techniques, as well as from curated databases, are better modeled by geometricrandom graphs than by Erdös-Rény, random scale-free, or Barabási-Albert scale-free networks.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2007	1.01	Bioinformatics	5.039	0.98
1024349505	Modelling protein-protein interaction networks via a stickiness index	What type of connectivity structure are we seeing in protein-protein interaction networks? A number of random graph models have been mooted. After fitting model parameters to real data, the models can be judged by their success in reproducing key network properties. Here, we propose a very simple random graph model that inserts a connection according to the degree, or stickiness', of the two proteins involved. This model can be regarded as a testable distillation of more sophisticated versions that attempt to account for the presence of interaction surfaces or binding domains. By computing a range of network similarity measures, including relative graphlet frequency distance, we find that our model outperforms other random graph classes. In particular, we show that given the underlying degree information, fitting a stickiness model produces better results than simply choosing a degree-matching graph uniformly at random. Therefore, the results lend supportto the basic modelling methodology.	gbr	The Royal Society	2006	1.01	Journal of the Royal Society interface	0.930	1.905
1024349761	Efficient estimation of graphlet frequency distributions in protein-protein interaction networks	Motivation: Algorithmic and modeling advances in the area of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis could contribute to the understanding of biological processes. Local structure of networks can be measured by the frequency distribution of graphlets, small connected non-isomorphic induced subgraphs. This measure of local structure has been used to show that high-confidence PPI networks have local structure of geometric random graphs. Finding graphlets exhaustively in a large network is computationally intensive. More complete PPI networks, as well as PPI networks of higher organisms, will thus require efficient heuristic approaches. Results: We propose two efficient and scalable heuristics for finding graphlets in high-confidence PPI networks.We show that both PPI and their model geometric random networks, have defined boundaries that are sparser than the inner parts' of the networks. In addition, these networks exhibit uniformity' of local structure inside the networks. Our first heuristic exploits these two structural properties of PPI and geometric random networks to find good estimates of graphlet frequency distributions in these networks up to 690 times faster than the exhaustive searches. Our second heuristic is a variant of a more standard sampling technique and it produces accurate approximate results up to 377 times faster than the exhaustive searches.Weindicate how thecombination of these approaches may result in an even better heuristic.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2006	1.01	Bioinformatics	4.894	0.972
1024350017	2-Tree probe interval graphs have a large obstruction set	Probe interval graphs (PIGs) are used as a generalization of interval graphs in physical mapping of DNA. G=(V ,E) is a probe interval graph (PIG) with respect to a partition (P,N) of V if vertices of G correspond to intervals on a real line and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals intersect and at least one of them is in P; vertices belonging to P are called probes and vertices belonging to N are called non-probes. One common approach to studying the structure of a new family of graphs is to determine if there is a concise family of forbidden induced subgraphs. It has been shown that there are two forbidden induced subgraphs that characterize tree PIGs. In this paper we show that having a concise forbidden induced subgraph characterization does not extend to 2-tree PIGs; in particular, we show that there are at least 62 minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for 2-treePIGs.	nld	North-Holland	2005	1.01	Discrete Applied Mathematics	0.585	0.781
1024350273	Modeling interactome	Motivation: Networks have been used to model many realworld phenomena to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their behavior. Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as possible. As a result, new techniques andmodels for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced. Results: One example of large and complex networks involves protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We analyze PPI networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster using a newly introduced measure of local network structure as well as the standardly used measures of global network structure. We examine the fit of four different network models, including Erdös-Rényi, scale-free and geometric random networkmodels, to these PPI networks with respect to the measures of local andglobal network structure. We demonstrate that the currently accepted scale-free model of PPI networks fails to fit the data in several respects andshow that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the PPI data. We hypothesize that only the noise in these networks is scale-free. Conclusions: We systematically evaluate how well-different networkmodels fit the PPI networks. We show that the structure of PPI networksis better modeled by a geometric random graph than by a scale-free model.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2004	1.01	Bioinformatics	5.742	0.91
1024350529	Protein complex prediction via cost-based clustering	Motivation: Understanding principles of cellular organization and function canbe enhanced if we detect known and predict still undiscovered protein complexes within the cell's protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Such predictions may be used as an inexpensive tool to direct biological experiments. The increasing amount of available PPI data necessitates an accurate and scalable approach to protein complex identification. Results: We have developed the Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering Algorithm (RNSC) to efficiently partition networks into clusters using a cost function. We applied this cost-based clustering algorithm to PPI networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to identify andpredict protein complexes. We have determined functional and graph-theoretic properties of true protein complexes from the MIPS database. Based on these properties, we defined filters to distinguish between identified network clusters and true protein complexes. Conclusions: Our application of the cost-based clustering algorithm provides an accurate and scalable method of detecting and predicting protein complexes within a PPI network.

The cumulative PPI data set in Saccharomyces cerevisiae now exceeds 78 000. Studying the network of these interactions will provide valuable insight into the inner workings of cells. Results:We performed a systematic graph theory-based analysis of this PPI network to construct computational models for describing and predicting the properties of lethal mutations and proteins participating in genetic interactions, functional groups, protein complexes and signaling pathways. Ouranalysis suggests that lethal mutations are not only highly connected within the network, but they also satisfy an additional property: their removal causes a disruption in network structure. We also provide evidence forthe existence of alternate paths that bypass viable proteins in PPI networks, while such paths do not exist for lethal mutations. In addition, we show that distinct functional classes of proteins have differing network properties.We also demonstrate a way to extract and iteratively predict protein complexes and signaling pathways. We evaluate the power of predictionsby comparing them with a random model, and assess accuracy of predictions by analyzing their overlap with MIPS database. Conclusions: Our models provide a means for understanding the complex wiring underlying cellular function, and enable us to predict essentiality, genetic interaction,function, protein complexes and cellular pathways. This analysis uncovers structure-function relationships observable in a large PPI network.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2004	1.01	Bioinformatics	5.742	0.91

We saythat a graph is a hereditary dominating pair (HDP) graph if each of its connected induced subgraphs contains a dominating pair. In this paper we introduce the notion of frame HDP graphs in order to capture the structure of HDP graphs that contain asteroidal triples.

Similarly, ?$\Gamma$? is weakly ?$n$?-HP-extendable if it contains a path of length ?$n$? and if every such path is contained in some Hamilton path of ?$\Gamma$?. Moreover, ?$\Gamma$? is strongly ?$n$?-HP-extendable if it contains a path of length ?$n$? and if for every such path $P$ there is a Hamilton path of ?$\Gamma$? starting with ?$P$?.

1024369492	Decomposition of skew-morphisms of cyclic groups	A skew-morphism of a group ?$H$? is a permutation ?$\sigma$? of its elements fixing the identity such that for every ?$x, y \in H$? there exists an integer ?$k$? such that ?$\sigma (xy) = \sigma (x)\sigma k(y)$?. It follows that group automorphisms are particular skew-morphisms. Skew-morphisms appear naturally in investigations of maps on surfaces with high degree of symmetry, namely, they are closely related to regular Cayley maps and to regular embeddings of the complete bipartite graphs. The aim of this paper is to investigate skew-morphisms of cyclic groups in the context of the associated Schur rings. We prove the following decomposition theorem about skew-morphisms of cyclic groups ?$\mathbb Z_n$?: if ?$n = n_{1}n_{2}$? such that ?$(n_{1}n_{2}) = 1$?, and ?$(n_{1}, \varphi (n_{2})) = (\varphi (n_{1}), n_{2}) = 1$? (?$\varphi$? denotes Euler's function) then all skew-morphisms ?$\sigma$? of ?$\mathbb Z_n$? are obtained as ?$\sigma = \sigma_1 \times \sigma_2$?, where ?$\sigma_i$? are skew-morphisms of ?$\mathbb Z_{n_i}, \; i = 1, 2$?. As a consequence we obtain the following result: All skew-morphisms of ?$\mathbb Z_n$? are automorphisms of ?$\mathbb Z_n$? if and only if ?$n = 4$? or ?$(n, \varphi(n)) = 1$?.	svn	Drutvo matematikov, fizikov in astronomov	2011	1.01	Ars mathematica contemporanea	0.400	0.677

In [K. Handa, Bipartite graphs with balanced ?$(a,b)$?-partitions, Ars Combin. 51 (1999), 113-119] Handa asked whether every bipartite distance-balanced graph, that is not a cycle, is 3-connected. In this paper the Handa question is answered in the negative. Moreover, we show that a minimal bipartite distance-balanced graph, that is not a cycle and is not 3-connected, has 18 vertices and is unique. In addition, we give a complete classification of non-3-connected bipartite distance-balanced graphs for which the minimal distance between two vertices in a 2-cut is three. All such graphs are regular and for each ?$k \geq 3$? there exists an infinite family of such graphs which are ?$k$?-regular.Furthermore, we determine a number of structural properties that a bipartite distance-balanced graph, which is not 3-connected, must have. As an application, we give a positive answer to the Handa question for the subfamily of bipartite strongly distance-balanced graphs.	gbr	Academic Press	2012	1.01	European journal of combinatorics	0.677	0.677

1024390740	Hamilton cycles in (2, odd, 3)-Cayley graphs	In 1969, Lovász asked if every finite, connected vertex-transitive graph has a Hamilton path. In spite of its easy formulation, no major breakthrough has been achieved thus far, and the problem is now commonly accepted to be very hard. The same holds for the special subclass of Cayley graphs where the existence of Hamilton cycles has been conjectured. In 2007, Glover and Maruiè proved that a cubic Cayley graph on a finite ?$(2, s, 3)$?-generated group ?$G = \langle a, x| a^2 = x^s = (ax)^3 = 1, \dots \rangle$? has a Hamilton path when ?$|G|$? is congruent to 0 modulo 4, and has a Hamilton cycle when ?$|G|$? is congruent to 2 modulo 4. The Hamilton cycle was constructed, combining the theory of Cayley maps with classical results on cyclic stability in cubic graphs, as the contractible boundary of a tree of faces in the corresponding Cayley map. With a generalization of these methods, Glover, Kutnar and Maruiè in 2009 resolved the case when, apart from ?$|G|$?, also ?$s$? is congruent to 0 modulo 4. In this article, with a further extension of the above ""tree of faces"" approach, a Hamilton cycle is shown to exist whenever ?$|G|$? is congruent to 0 modulo 4 and s is odd. This leaves ?$|G|$? congruent to 0 modulo 4 with s congruent to 2 modulo 4 as the only remaining open case. In this last case, however, the ""tree of faces"" approach cannot be applied, and so entirely different techniques will have to be introduced if one is to complete the proof of the existence of Hamilton cycles in cubic Cayley graphs arising from finite ?$(2, s, 3)$?-generated groups.	gbr	Clarendon Press	2012	1.01	Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society	1.324	0.677

We need a combination of at least two, but best if three, social forces to structure the social field in order to exhibitpositive adaptation to global trends. This implies that the ability of social settings to meet challenges posed by global trends can indeed be a subject of rational action.	hrv	Institut za drutvena istraivanja	2011	1.01	Sociologija i prostor	0.000	0.924

Results are showing that municipalities with different backgrounds can be compared and ranked according to their performance on the basis of this model.	rou	Faculty of Political Sciences, Public Administration and Communication	2012	1.01	Transylvanian review of administrative sciences	0.284	0.788
1024467777	Evidence for network evolution in an Arabidopsis interactome map	Plants have unique features that evolved in response to their environments andecosystems. A full account of the complex cellular networks that underlie plant-specific functions is still missing. We describe a proteome-wide binary protein-protein interaction map for the interactome network of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana containing about 6200 highly reliable interactions between about 2700 proteins. A global organization of plant biological processes emerges from community analyses of the resulting network, together with large numbers of novel hypothetical functional links between proteins andpathways. We observe a dynamic rewiring of interactions following gene duplication events, providing evidence for a model of evolution acting upon interactome networks. This and future plant interactome maps should facilitatesystems approaches to better understand plant biology and improve crops.	usa	American Association for the Advancement of Science	2011	1.01	Science	31.201	2.355
1024474177	The impact of conservative discourses in family policies, population politics, and gender rights in Poland and Turkey	This article uses childcare as a case study to test the impact of ideas that embody a traditional understanding of gender relations in relation to childcare. Conservative ideas regard increasing female labor market participation as a cause of decreasing fertility on the functioning of a set of general policies to increase fertility rates. It looks into the Polish and Turkish contexts for empirical evidence. The Polish context shows a highly institutionalized system of family policies in contrast to almost unessential institutions in Turkey. Formally, the labor market participation of women is much lower in Turkey than in Poland. Yet, given the size of the informal market in Turkey, women's labor participation is obviously higher than what appears in the statistics. Bearing in mind this divergence, the article suggests Poland and Turkey as two typologies for studying population politics in contexts where socially conservative ideas regarding gender remain paramount. We qualify ideas as conservative if they enforce a traditional understanding of gender relations in care-giving and underline women's role inthe labor market as an element of declining fertility. In order to delineateideational impact, this article looks into how ideas (a) supplant and(b) substitute formal institutions. Therefore, we argue that there are two mechanisms pertaining to the dominance of conservative conventions: conservative ideas may either supplant the institutional impact on family policies, or substitute them thanks to a superior reasoning which societies assign to them. Furthermore, conservative conventions prevail alongside women's customary unpaid work as care-givers regardless of the level of their formal workforce participation. We propose as our major findings for the literature of population politics that ideas, as ubiquitous belief systems, are more powerful than institutions since they provide what is perceived as legitimate, acceptable, and good for the societies under study. In the end, irrespective of the presence of institutions, socially conservative ideas prevail.	gbr	Oxford University Press	2011	1.01	Social politics	1.077	0.66
1024474689	Reversing the wave	This article takes the conservative shift in Polish politics under PiS as an example and argues that the failure of the liberal economy could end up reversing the fast-forward wave in human rights. And because Poland is a relatively new member of the EU, the article also develops the argument that such a reversal in the new member countries could make the European Union's (EU) acquis irrelevant for further democratisation. Therefore, the article fi rst explains how the failure of the economic liberalism of the neo-liberal market economy paves the way for the success of conservative political parties. It then raises the question of why political liberalism, promoted by the EU's human rights acquis, is also a target for the opponents of the marketeconomy. The article concludes with a discussion of current Polish politics in the aftermath of the October 2007 elections.	cze	Academia	2009	1.01	Sociologický èasopis	0.562	0.891
1024480833	Quality of governance in ""Old"" and ""New"" EU member states in a comparative perspective	A question arises whether the quality of governance of the ""old"" EU member states is greater than that of the ""new"" ones. Intuitively speaking, ""old"" member states should fare much better. In the article, a measure of the quality of governance is presented, based on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) for 1996, 2003 and 2010. According to the authors,the quality of governance consists of three components: system persistence, inclusiveness and effectiveness. Findings indicate that most of the ""old"" EU member states perform much better with respect to the quality of governance compared to their ""new"" counterparts. Further, the relationship between the quality of governance and some aspects of socio-economic development is examined. In this regard, a strong correlation between most of the elements under consideration is detected. In conclusion, the authors assume that if the EU chooses not to elicit a higher quality of governance of its member states, it is destined to become a melee of states characterised byenormously different levels of democratic potential. As a consequence, inevitably, a question will arise as to the sustainability and sense of purpose of its very existence.	svk	Slovak Academic Press	2012	1.01	Sociológia	0.191	0.924
10248731	Computer simulation of anisotropic polymer brushes	A polymer brush with chains consisting of anisotropic monomers, in a liquid consisting of free spherical particles, is studied by the molecular dynamics method. It is shown that, at some value of the concentration of spheres, a liquid-crystal or oriented-domain transition occurs in the brush. A densely-grafted brush and a sparsely-grafted brush are studiedè for this system, the transition point seems not to depend strongly upon the grafting density. In the case of the densely-grafted brush, a liquid-crystal transitionproceeds via an intermediate microphase segregated state. One microphase, located near the grafting surface, is characterized by high density and high degree of ordering of monomers. This part of the brush contains only a small concentration of spheres. On the periphery of the brush,a disordered microphase with low monomer density is located. This part of the brush is enriched with spherical particles. The two microphases are separated by a well-defined boundary. On increasing the sphere concentration, the boundary between microphases shifts towards the periphery, and eventually the ordered microphase extends through the whole brush volume. The monomers ofthe densely-grafted brush in their ordered state form different structures, namely, a smectic structure at relatively low values of sphere concentration, and a structure of orientationally ordered domains at the higher sphere densities.	gbr	Royal Society of Chemistry	2008	1.01	Soft matter	4.586	1.953
10250268	The Dialectical Systems Theory's Capacity for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making	The article introduces the Quantified Dialectical Systems Theory, which is one of the cases of new systems theories. It arises from the need for the appropriate knowledge about the basics of both systems theory and the applied computer supported qualitative and quantitative methods that can help individuals or groups in researching important complex decision-making problems; among them we emphasize the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) ones. Moreover, the article presents the framework procedure for MCDM, based on assigning weights, which we developed by following the original procedures of several MCDM methods, adapted mainly by the conclusions of experts in practice regarding the suitability of different multi-criteria methods, and own experience. We demonstrate how the Dialectical Systems Theory's (DST's) guidelines defining the subjective starting points can be followed when approaching MCDM problems step-by-step, as well as the DST's guidelines concerning implementation of starting points. In the efforts to support creating and decision-making it helps a lot, if the application of theory can take place in an informal style. This article introduces ways of incorporation of informal systemic thinking and the DST's guidelines in the framework procedure for MCDM when solving several real-life complex problems, presented by example cases.	gbr	John Wiley & Sons	2010	1.01	Systems research and behavioral science	0.706	0.809
10259222	When and how to develop domain-specific language	Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They ofter substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage.Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns. We also discuss domain analysis tools and language development systems that may help to speed up DSL development. Finally, we present a number of open problems.	usa	Association for Computing Machinery	2005	1.01	ACM computing surveys	7.400	1.183
10263830	Improved method for shot particle velocity measurement within a shotblasting chamber	This paper presents the application of two axially-spaced impact detecting sensors for correlation-based shot velocity measurement. The sensors were placed directly into the flow of shot particles for sensing the particles' impact. The implementation of cross-correlation for phase shift determination, however, was not an easy task. Several extensive improvements were necessary, before the original measurement system, already presented in this journal in December 2003, was capable of reliable velocity measurements. This paper presents the development of the system and optimisation of its components. The construction of a sensor built from a small microphone encapsulated in a metal housing and placed under a protective shield was optimised for a high ratio of frontal to side impact signal alteration. High vibration damping was also necessary. It was achieved by the combination of a well-weighted design for supporting elements and by a careful selection of used materials. These measures improved the similarity of the signals generated by the particlesæ impact, significantly, and allowed the use of cross-correlation. The accuracy of the obtained results increased drastically by the application of cross-correlation, signal filtering was unnecessary and the signal processing was much faster.	gbr	Butterworth	2006	1.01	Flow measurement and instrumentation	0.600	0.741
10266139	The influence of inertial loading on color gamut properties of a TFT LCD display	The article presents the results of an experiment where a 7 in. TFT LCD display was exposed to harmonic vibration with acceleration amplitudes up to 200 m/s2 and frequency sweep in the range between 40 Hz and 1.5 kHz. The display was mounted on a shaker in three different positions: landscape, portrait, and face-up. Colorimetric measurements were taken during and after the loading. Euclidian distance in the CIE Lab color space was used as measureof color change due to the loading. The results show that color gamut tends to narrow when increasing the acceleration amplitude. In practical terms however the color change is barely perceptible. In most cases the color changes disappear within 5 h after the stop of the loading. Micro- and macroscopic examination of the LCD was performed to establish an indication ofthe cause of color change.	gbr	IPC Science and Technology Press	2008	1.01	Displays	1.768	1.318

The paper presents an algorithm for the design of such elements using numerical calculations on the basis of the finite elements method in connection with evolution optimization methods. The use of differential evolution (DE) and evolution strategy (ES) algorithms is presented in the case of modeling a medium-voltage post insulator, the secondary function of which is voltage indication. A comparison between these two algorithms is also presented. The task of both optimization algorithms is to find an adequate capacitance of the voltage divider and the optimal distribution of electric field strength. All other requirements and constraints that have to be taken into consideration in the design of insulation elements are also included in the algorithm.	usa	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2006	1.01	IEEE transactions on magnetics	0.938	0.942

The analyzed motor is to be built for special compressor applications; therefore, the standard star-delta windings are inappropriate. Until recently, winding schemes have been chosen using different analytical and experiential criteria. In this paper, a design process is presented based on transient numerical analysis with the rotation of the rotor also taken into consideration. The developed numerical model enables a study of the motor's performance under arbitrary load conditions, and, thus, the entire torque characteristics of the motor can be predicted. Furthermore, the effects of eddy currents in the motor shaft material and their influence on the magnetic field and the motor's performance have been analyzed. The numerical results have been verified by laboratory measurements.	usa	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2006	1.01	IEEE transactions on magnetics	0.938	0.942
10287643	Influence of contact conditions on tribological behaviour of DLC coatings	By providing excellent frictional properties and greatly improving wear resistance of sliding contact surfaces, diamond-like carbon coatings (DLC) offer a great opportunity for improving performance and durability, and reducing frictional losses in many mechanical systems. However, for the successful application of coated machine components, coatings have to perform reliably under dry and oil-lubricated conditions, with the majority of machinecomponents still being oil-lubricated and operating under diverse contact conditions. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the influence of contact conditions on the tribological behaviour of boundary lubricated DLC coatings, when using oils with extreme-pressure (EP) and anti-wear (AW) additives. Tests with ball-bearing steel ball being loaded against DLC coated discs were performed in the contact pressure range of 1.0 to 3.0 GPa, average sliding speeds of 0.01 to 0.15 m/s and at oil temperaturesranging from 20 to 200 °C. While phosphorous-based AW additives had only minor effects, sulphur-based EP additives were found to reduce friction and wear of W-containing DLC coatings. Furthermore, increase in contact pressure or temperature accelerates the process of friction reduction and results in lower friction while increase in sliding speed has the opposite effect.	che		2007	1.01	Surface & coatings technology	1.678	0.946
10290971	Thermal fatigue of materials for die-casting tooling	This research is conducted to study the thermal fatigue resistance of different hot-work tool steels; AISI H11 and H13, special tool steel and 18% Ni maraging steel. The maraging steel is surface cladded by GTA welding to study the thermal fatigue resistance of surface layer. An influence of mechanical and microstructural properties on thermal fatigue resistance is evaluated. An innovative apparatus for thermal fatigue testing is developed tostudy the thermal fatigue resistance. The test specimens are subjected to cyclic heating in bath of molten Aluminum Alloy 226 and cooling in bath of water-based lubricant. They are continuously internally cooled with cold water. The specimens are periodically analyzed after completion of particular number of cycles. The microstructure, hardness profile and the surface cracks developed are analyzed. Temperature transients at different locations of test specimen are measured and used in computation of transient stresses performed by finite elements. The specimens of special geometry are developed using finite element modeling to improve testing efficiency. An optimal set of thermal fatigue testing parameters are developed to establish efficient testing. The influence of thermal loading on tempering of hot work tool steel and on aging of maraging steel claddings during testing is determined. The results showed significant differences in thermal fatigue resistance of tested materials and their heat treatments. The best thermal fatigue resistance achieved special tool steel due to its high thermal stability. The resistance of AISI H11 tool steel is slightly superior to that of maraging steel weld.	nld	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Materials Science & Engineering	1.806	1.953
10296342	Shape optimization of truss-stiffened shell structures with variable thickness	This paper presents an effective approach to shape optimal design of statically loaded elastic shell-like structures. The shape parametrization is based on a design element technique. The chosen design element is a rational Bézier body, enhanced with a smoothly varying scalar field. A body-like designelement makes possible to unify the shape optimization of both pure shells and truss-stiffened shell structures. The scalar field of the design element is obtained by attaching to each control point a scalar quantity, which is an add-on to the position and weight of the control point. This scalar field is linked to the shell thickness distribution, which can be optimized simultaneously with the shape of the shell. For linear and non-linear analysis of shell structures, a reliable 4-node shell finite element formulation is utilized. The presented optimization approach assumes the employment of a gradient-based optimization algorithm and the use of the discrete method of direct differentiation to perform the sensitivity analysis.Four numerical examples of shell and truss-stiffened shell optimization are presented in detail to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.	usa	North-Holland	2006	1.01	Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering	2.015	0.746

Based on the data obtained by experts in the field, the authors analyse inward Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (C-B M&A) in European countries in 2004 and 2005. The authors questioned professionals at 91 European business schools dealing with the C-B M&A field. The questionnaire referred to positive effects and risks that inward C-B M&A are reportedly causing in European countries, as well as their treatment in the media and by economic policies. To enable a thorough insight into this process in Europe, the authors tested the differences between industrial European countries and the countries experiencing transition. As expected, the empirical analysis demonstrated differences in C-B M&A's economic effects and treatment between the two groups of countries. However, responses' analysis also pointed to the fact that due to the changes they bring to important sectors of industrial economies, C-B M&A also have transitional impact in those countries.	che	Inderscience Publishers	2010	1.01	European journal of international management	0.220	1.646
10304796	Impact of disturbing factors on cooperation in logistics outsourcing performance	The purpose of this paper is to present the research results of a study conducted in the Slovene logistics market of conflicts and opportunism as disturbing factors while examining their impact on cooperation in logistics outsourcing performance. Relationship variables are proposed that directly or indirectly affect logistics performance and conceptualize the hypotheses based on causal linkages for the constructs. On the basis of extant literature and new argumentations that are derived from in-depth interviews of logistics experts, including providers and customers, the measurement and structural models are empirically analyzed. Existing measurement scales for the constructs are slightly modified for this analysis. Purification testing and measurement for validity and reliability are performed. Multivariate statistical methods are utilized and hypotheses are tested. The results show that conflicts have a significantly negative impact on cooperation between customers and logistics service providers (LSPs), while opportunism does not play an important role in these relationships. The observed antecedents of logistics outsourcing performance in the model account for 58.4% of the variance of the goal achievement and 36.5% of the variance of the exceeded goal.	hrv	Fakultet prometnih znanosti;Fakulteta za pomorstvo in promet;Universita degli studi di Trieste, Istituto per lo studio dei transporti nell'integrazione economica europea;Fakultet za saobraèaj i komunikacije;Fakulta prevadzky a ekonomiky dopravy a spojov;Dopravni fakulta Jana Pernera	2010	1.02	Promet	0.125	0.978
10305052	Competitiveness by requisitely holistic and innovative logistic management	In the age of global expansion of business operations and contemporary way of life the material and information flows in and between different companies are growing rapidly; they are thus becoming more and more difficult to manage. Had business functions in companies been dealt with separately until now (purchase, production, finances, sale, etc.), today the emphasis is placed on their integration due to their interdependence. By studying supply chains inside and between business partners, companies can gain competitive advantage and become more adjustable, taking the increasingly changing market circumstances into account. This enables them to meet consumers' demands and expectations requisitely holistically. Taking all the crucial activities into account, the logistics management plays a key role in the companies facing the challenges of the new millennium. Based on the numerous megatrends, which influence each and every business entity, this article aims to explain the increasing strategic importance of logistics management. The latter may not be dealt with one-sidedly as a cost; moreover, the key aspects such as competitiveness as well as long-term existence of a company must also be considered.

Of the examined human Escherichia coli strains, 28% harbored one or two of the three F-like, RepFI replication regions, while 35% of the examined animal and all phytopathogenic strains harbored RepFIA-specific sequences. Comparative analysis of Salmonella, Shogella, Erwinia, and E. coli plasmid RepFI sequences showed 100% or very high homology, indicating frequent and recent interspecies gene transfer. The high incidence of RepFIA sequences in enteric bacterial species, including Klebsiella and Erwinia, showed that F-like plasmids are successful in avoiding natural barriers to establishment of horizontally transferred DNA and that in the natural environment conjugal transfer is efficient in diverse ecological niches.	usa	Springer-Verlag	2002	1.01	Current microbiology	1.210	2.437

As of 2010, the accounting aspect of business relationships between public enterprises and municipalities in Slovenia had to be redefined due to the abandonment of 'assets under management' reporting. The regulation recommending municipalities to hand over infrastructure to public enterprises in the form of an operating lease has resulted in the need for different accounting information on the part of the municipalities. Regarding the water sector of municipalities in Austria and Italy, the need for more comprehensive accounting information exists as well. Due to the application of New Public Management concepts, many countries have adopted or committed to adopt some variant of accrual accounting also for the public sector. The large-scale adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (the IPSASs) would significantly enhance the international public sector comparability.	svn	Intitut za lokalno samoupravo in javna naroèila	2010	1.01	Lex localis	0.317	0.759

Experimental measurements and simulations of the flow over a hydrofoil in a closed circuit cavitation tunnel were performed. Using the LDA method the velocity profile, 365 mm upstream of the hydrofoil, was measured. PIV method combined with the LIF technique was used for the determination of the velocity field in the vicinity of the hydrofoil. Static pressure at 38 positions on the surface of the hydrofoil was measured. The CFD code Fluent was used for the simulations. A RANS approach with the k-e RNG turbulence model was applied. Two simulations of the fluid flow were performed- one with a uniform (ideal) velocity profile at the inlet of the computational domain and the other with the experimentally determined velocityprofile. The simulation with the ideal boundary condition produced rather poor results with a considerable discrepancy to the experimental measurements. On the other hand the simulation produced more accurate results when the real (measured) boundary condition was used.

These magnetic fields are caused by ionic currents that appear after injury in different parts of the plant. All measured V. faba plants responded to the burning stimulation with detectable quasi-d.c. magnetic signals. In order to measure these signals, a suitable modulation had to be used. The covariance method was applied to analyse the measured data. The results demonstrate a dipolar-like magnetic signal, exponentially decreasing in time, above the cutting type of injury. After burning stimulation, the magnetically detected activity was concentrated predominantly above the leaves/petioles and less above the stem. Possible mechanism for this behaviour are suggested. A comparison with previously known electrical measurements of plant injury is given.	deu	Springer	2000	1.01	European biophysics journal	2.188	2.504
10323739	Analysis of wave propagation in fluid-filled viscoelastic pipes	This paper describes the investigation of the propagation wave speed and wave attenuation in viscoelastic fluid-filled pipes. Relatively predictable for metal pipes, these are largely unknown for plastic pipes, since they depend onthe pipe wall properties. Wave number measurements, encompassing both wave speed and wave attenuation, were carried out on different water-filled plastic pipes using three hydrophones. The frequency-dependent wave speed and attenuation were calculated from the transfer function between three pressure measurements. Experimental results for different pipe wall materials, particularly those with applications in water supply installations, are presented. The purpose of this paper is to present a method of analysis in the frequency domain that can be used to determine the acoustical properties of fluid-filled plastic pipes.	gbr	Academic Press	2007	1.01	Mechanical systems and signal processing	1.333	0.706

1033073	The influence of stirring rate on biopharmaceutical properties of Eudragit microspheres	Abstract: Eudragit RS microspheres containing pipemidic acid, as a model drug,were prepared by the solvent evaporation method using an acetone/liquid paraffin solvent system. The aim of the work was to evaluate the influence of stirring rate on the average particle size, particle morphology, drug content and release kinetics, as well as the influence of particle size on microspheremorphology, drug content and release kinetics. Stirring rate has been found to significantly influence the average diameter of microspheres. The average diameter decreases as the stirring rate increases. This can be explained by production of a finer dispersion of droplets when higher stirringrates are applied and, consequently, by the formation of smaller microspheres. With increasing stirring rate and increasing fraction particle size the drug content also increases. It is assumed that this dependence is a consequence of an uneven diffusion of the drug from the inner to the outer emulsion phase, and an uneven encapsulation of drug particles during the preparation. Drug release follows the Higuchi model. As seen from SEM photographs, larger microspheres are more porous and the microspheres producedat higher stirring rates are more porous than those produced at lower stirring rates. This explains the unexpected finding that the release rate increases as the fraction particle size and the stirring rate increase.	gbr	Taylor & Francis	2002	1.01	Journal of microencapsulation	1.024	0.712
10333718	Upper-bound solutions of three-dimensional passive earth pressures	This paper presents a novel approach to the determination of passive soil pressures: using the upper-bound method within the framework of limit analysistheory. It is based on a three-dimensional, kinematically admissible, rotational, hyperbolical failure mechanism. The failure mechanism is composed of the central and two lateral bodies, which are connected by a common velocity field. This approach is similar to two-dimensional stability analyses, where the log spiral potential failure surface is considered. The front surface of the central body interacts with the retaining wallè the uppersurface can be loaded by surcharge loadingè and the log spiral segment defines the curved failure surface of the central part. The cross sections of the lateral bodies are in agreement with the cross section of the central body. On the outer side, they are laterally bounded by a curved and kinematically admissible hyperbolic surface, which is defined by enveloping the hyperbolical half cones and part of the case surface of the leading half cone. The results give values for the passive soil pressure coefficients that are for most cases lower than the values determined by the upper-bound method of limit analysis for a translational failure mechanism, as published in the literature.	can	National Research Council of Canada	2005	1.01	Canadian geotechnical journal	0.697	0.59
10335515	Percentage of harmful discharges for surface current density monitoring in electrical discharge machining process	Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is performed in the gap between the workpiece (usually the anode) and the electrode (usually the cathode). The gapis filled with a dielectric and the pulses generated by a special generatorcause an electrical breakdown in the gap. A breakdown discharge occurs which removes material from the workpiece. The EDM process has been used for more than 50 years, but the influence of the surface current density on the process stability is not well understood. The surface current density is very important in the case of the machining of rough surfaces where the highest material removal rate (MRR) is preferred. For a given eroding surface there exists an optimal electrical current at which the highest MRR is achieved. It is reported in the literature that the percentage of the discharges that are harmful to the EDM process depends on the surface current density in the gap. Thus, experiments were performed to find out the possibility of using the percentage of harmful discharges to monitor the surface current density of the EDM process.	gbr	Mechanical Engineering Publications	2007	1.01	Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers	0.203	0.706
10337307	Correlation between the local climate and the free-cooling potential of latent heat storage	The natural cooling of energy-efficient buildings using latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) that is integrated into the building services makes possible energy savings and improved thermal comfort. In this article, studiesof the free-cooling potential for different climatic locations are presented. Six cities from around Europe with a wide range of climatic conditions were selected. The size of the LHTES was optimized on the basis of the calculated cooling degree-hours. First, we analysed the influence of the width of the phase change temperature range and determined the optimal meltingtemperature of the phase change material (PCM). Then, the optimal LHTESwas selected, based on the ratio of the mass of the PCM and the volume flow rate of air ventilating the building. We found that the optimum PCM has amelting temperature that is approximately equal to the average ambient air temperature in the hottest month, and that the free-cooling potential is proportional to the average daily amplitude of the ambient airæs temperature swings. For all the analysed climatic conditions the PCM with a wider phase change temperature range (12 K) was found to be the most efficient. The optimal size of the LHTES for the free cooling of buildings is between 1 and 1.5 kg of PCM per m3/h of fresh ventilation air.	che	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Energy and buildings	1.590	0.763

Impedance spectra were interpreted in terms of a model by Armstrong [2, 3], describing the electrochemical reaction at interfaces with adsorbed intermediates. The present work was performed in order to study this phenomenon in more detail, with computer simulations of a new created and more convenient equivalent circuit in comparison with the former model. Computer simulations of equivalent circuits were also made in the region of passivity which was also continuation of our earlier work [4]. In this sense the entire study for these steels was completed by collating distinctive parameter values, demonstrating electrochemical characteristics of steel X20Cr13, undergoing different heat treatments in the active-passive and passive region.	deu	VCH	2006	1.01	Materials and corrosion	0.500	0.68
10339350	Fuel cell entropy production with ohmic heating and diffusive polarization	In this article, entropy production of ohmic heating and concentration polarization is investigated for two types of fuel cells (PEMFC and SOFC). Ohmic entropy production arises from resistance to electron flow through the electrodes, as well as ion flow through the electrolyte. Ohm's law is applied to both ion and electron flows, when formulating the entropy production. Also, entropy production arises from changes in concentration of the reactants, during fuel consumption at the electrode surfaces. Unlike past methods developed for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), this article formulates entropy production within electrodes of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Predicted results of cell irreversibilities are successfully validated against measured data. The entropy based method provides a useful alternative to past schemes aiming to reduce voltage losses with polarization curves, as entropy production is directly governed by the Second Law and it encompasses both electrochemical and thermofluid irreversibilities within a fuel cell.	gbr	Pergamon Press.	2006	1.01	International journal of heat and mass transfer	1.482	0.741
10339355	Thermodynamical analysis of human thermal comfort	Traditional methods of human thermal comfort analysis are based on the first law of thermodynamics. These methods use an energy balance of the human body to determine heat transfer between the body and its environment. By contrast, the second law of thermodynamics introduces the useful concept of exergy. It enables the determination of the exergy consumption within the human body dependent on human and environmental factors. Human body exergy consumption varies with the combination of environmental (room) conditions. This process is related to human thermal comfort in connection with temperature, heat, and mass transfer. In this paper a thermodynamic analysis of human heat and mass transfer based on the 2nd law of thermodynamics in presented. It is shown thatthe human bodyæs exergy consumption in relation to selected human parameters exhibits a minimal value at certain combinations of environmental parameters. The expected thermal sensation also shows that there is a correlation between exergy consumption and thermal sensation. Thus, our analysis represents an improvement in human thermal modelling and gives more information about the environmental impact on expected human thermal sensation.	che	Elsevier	2006	1.01	Energy	0.935	0.905

10342683	Laser refining of a surface layer with silicon carbide	The article discusses the effect of adding silicon carbide by laser remelting of low-carbon steel. Tests in laser remelting were carried out with energy inputs ranging between 10 and 80 J/mm2 with the most favorable degree, i.e., 30%, of overlapping of individual trace. Sufficient energy input was necessaryto dissolve silicon-carbide with iron. A microchemical analysis of the remelted layer confirmed the dissolution of silicon carbide and formation of a smaller portion of martensite (10-20%) and of suesite Fe3Si (65-80%). It was found that the test-specimen deformation was smallest with the laser-beam in the zig-zag motion. The surface was also assessed visually. The choice of adequate remelting conditions reduced, i.e., prevented, the occurrence of cracks and other defects. The influence of energy input and the mode of laser-beam travel on the efficiency of remelting, i.e., refining, was described by a ratio of the width of the remelted surface layer to its depth, which should amount to around 5:1.	usa	Marcel Dekker	2008	1.01	Materials and manufacturing processes	0.706	0.905
10346504	Complex calcium oscillations and the role of mitochondria and cytosolic proteins	Intracellular calcium oscillations, which are oscillatory changes of cytosolic calcium concentration in response to agonist stimulation, are experimentally well observed in various living cells. Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority (80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode	nld	North-Holland	2000	1.01	Biosystems	0.699	1.778

The performance of a hydraulic axial piston pump with DLC-coated piston shoes was evaluated in a newly designed, dedicated hydraulic test system using fully formulated biodegradable, synthetic ester oil. For comparison, an equal but separated hydraulic system with a conventional commercial pump and stainless-steel shoe surfaces was tested. The tests were run at 85% of the maximum pump load and anoil temperature of around 80°C for a period of 2000 h, which corresponds tomore than 1 yr of continuous 8 h/day operation in an application. A major abrupt oxidation-induced degradation of the oil did not occur in either system; however, the oil from the system comprising the DLC-coated shoes showed noticeably and consistently better results. The wear of the DLC-coated shoes, especially during the running in, was much lower than that in the conventional steel system. Only minor polishing wear was observed on the DLC shoe's sliding surfaces during the test period, while on the steel shoe's surfaces, many scratches were found and some erosion of the edges was detected.	usa	American Society of Mechanical Engineers	2008	1.01	Journal of tribology	0.722	0.986

More severe clinical signs and higher mortality were observed in male birds. Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) was isolated in pure culture from tracheas of the affected birds in both outbreakes. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test showed the presence of antibodies to ORT in sera of birds from both clinically affected flocks and also in two flocks of younger birds without clinical signs. Immunoblotting with ORT culture isolated during the outbreak as an antigen confirmed the presence of antibodies to ORT in sera of turkeys of all four flocks examined. In addition, three different serologic assays also detected antibodies to Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) in three out of four flocks. The contamitant infection with MS did show an obvious effect on mortality rates nor on the antibody response against ORT. Younger birds appeared to be less succeptible to ORT pathogenicity because in those flocks the infection was subclinical.	usa	American Association of Avian Pathologists	2000	1.01	Avian diseases	1.306	0.587

10355484	Estimating Coal Price Dynamics with the Principal Components Method	The future use of coal depends on environmental protection measures and the Kyoto Protocol, the price of CO2 emission coupons, consumption, new technologies, the price of other energy sources and the liberalization of the electricity markets. The prices of emission coupons will impact the costs of electricity energy production. Due to the relatively higher reference costs of alternative energy sources, we can not expect that the share of coal as an energy source will lower significantly as a source of electricity production in the future. From the point of view of regional economic aspects and the reference costs of electricity production, we could state that using coal in the near future is also tied to the socio-economic aspects of mining domestic coal. Using it in thermo plants is also enabled by the conditions of priority dispatching (since 2000) in the EU economies. We assessed the influence of prices and the use of other energy sources, environmental measures, energy efficiency and the influence of electricity market liberalisation on coal price movements. Our estimation shows that, if the prices of other energy sources and electricity increase, the price of coal increases. If the use of other energy sources increases, and if the gross uses of industrial waste and renewable resources increase, the price of coal decreases. Environmental protection measures contribute to an increase in coal prices. A higher quotient of energy efficiency decelerates the price of coal. And the euro (to dollar) appreciation decelerates coal prices.	rou	Expert	2010	1.01	Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting	0.438	1.022

10355990	The influence of thread twist on alterations in fibers` mechanucl properties	In order to design high-quality threads, it is necessary to know the properties of threads and fibers, as well as the loadings and deformations which may occur during the sewing process. Thread properties depend on the mechanical properties of the fiber and the constructional parameters of the thread and its surface treatment, which directly influence sewing performance.The mechanical properties of a thread primarily depend on the fiber mechanical properties and the amount of twist. Knowledge of the thread dynamic loadings during the sewing process, depending on the number of turns and the lubrication method, is important for planning the required processing properties of the thread. This paper presents research into the influence of thread twist and the lubrication method on the mechanical properties and dynamic load of PES core-spun thread and its fibers. Research into the mechanical properties of the different twisted and surface treated threads, and separated fibers was carried out for this purpose. The influence of threaddynamic load during a sewing process was also researched regarding any alterations in the mechanical properties of the threads and separated fibers. Analyses of the results show that the amount of twist depends on the mechanical properties of the thread and its constituent fibers, whilst the method of surface treatment is based on the specific mechanical properties of the thread. A dynamic load causes greater or smaller thread deformations, which is reflected in changes in the thread and fiber mechanical properties. The occurred changes depend on dynamic load, amount of twist, and the lubrication method, which is confirmed with statistical analysis of the measured results.	usa	Sage Publications	2006	1.01	Textile research journal	0.578	0.597
1035625	Improving balance in subacute stroke patients	The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of balance training in a balance trainer, a newly developed mechanical device for training balance, with conventional balance training in subacute stroke patients. This was a randomized controlled study. Fifty participants met the inclusion criteria and 39 finished the study. The participants were randomly divided into control and balance trainer groups. The first had conventional balance training while the second trained balance in the balance trainer. All the participants trained balance 20 min per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks and had additional 25 min of physiotherapy. Balance was assessed by the Berg Balance Scale, one-leg standing, Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test and 10 m walk. There was significant improvement in Berg Balance Scale (P<0.001), TUG (P<0.001) and 10 m walk (P=0.001) in both the groups, whereas no differences were found in any of these measures between the two groups either regarding overall average level or regarding average improvement. Both the groups improved significantly in standing on the healthy (P=0.001) as well as the impaired lower limb (P=0.005), whereby no significant differences were observed between the groups. Within both groups, significantly fewer subjects needed assistance of a physiotherapist for the 10 m walk and the TUG test at the end than at the beginning of the study (P=0.016). It can be concluded that both conventional balance training and training balance in the balance trainer equally improved balance in subacute stroke patients. The balance trainer cannot replace a physiotherapist but it is a safe and efficient supplementary method.	gbr	Lipincott Williams & Wilkins	2010	1.01	International journal of rehabilitation research	1.192	1.126

A practical applicability of the established interdependence is verified on fiverandomly selected samples of natural soils. The selected approach to the analysis of the influence of soils composition on the water content at different stress states allows for the first time to establish generally validcriteria for determining such relationship.	nld	North-Holland	2006	1.01	Mechanics of materials	2.106	1.092

Therefore, many investigations are related to their design in order to improve the charging efficiency and to achieve theuniform distribution of fresh air among the engine cylinders. This paper deals with the design procedure of a cheap multipoint injection intake system,adapted to a racing car engine. Some special demands had to be taken into consideration. The intake manifold must contain the imposed constraint for the airflow in the shape of a single circular restrictor placed between the throttle and the engine to limit its power. The flow and the pressure lossreduction in the engine intake region were investigated with computationalfluid dynamics software. Two different geometries of the intake manifold were taken into consideration. On the basis of the numerically obtained three-dimensional results, a mathematical model of the engine with a more appropriate intake was made in the engine simulation code in order to anticipate its characteristics. The intake system was designed, practically manufactured, and tested in the laboratory. The experimental results confirmednumerical predictions, justifying the simple and relatively quick design procedure for the intake system.	gbr	The Institution of Mechanical Engineers	2006	1.01	Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers	0.254	0.72

Diet, liberation from maternal stores and endogenous synthesis from precursors may contribute to PUFA present in human milk. Other factors influencing lipid content and fatty acid composition such as gestational age, stage of lactation, nutritional status and genetical background are known. In a series of in vivo studies using stable isotope methodologies we investigated the metabolism of PUFA during lactation. With this techniques the transfer of single dietary fatty acids into human milk, the oxidation and the deposition in tissues were estimated. Our studies demonstrate that the major part of PUFA in human milk seems not to be derived directly from the maternal diet but from body stores. Nevertheless diet is important, because long term intakes sffect composition of body stores.	usa	Kluwer Academic	2000	1.01	Advances in experimental medicine and biology	0.513	2.372

The aim of our research is the design of a computer-aided, intelligent and genetic algorithm(GA) based programming system for CNC cutting tools selection, tool sequences planning and optimisation of cutting conditions. The first step is geometrical feature recognition and classification. On the basis of recognised features the module for GA-based determination of technological data determine cutting tools, cutting parameters (according to work piece material and cutting tool material) and detailed tool sequence planning. Material, which will be removed, is split into several cuts, each consisting of a number of basic tool movements. In thenext step, GA operations such as reproduction, crossover and mutation are applied. The process of GA-based optimisation runs in cycles in which new generations of individuals are created with increased average fitness of a population. During the evaluation of calculated results (generated NC programmes) several rules and constraints like rapid and cutting tool movement, collision, clamping and minimum machining time, which represent the fitness function, were taken into account. A case study was made for the turning operation of a rotational part. The results show that the GA-based programming has a higher efficiency. The total machining time was reduced by 16%. The demand for a high skilled worker on CAD/CAM systems and CNC machine tools was also reduced.	gbr	Kluwer Academic Publishers	2006	1.01	Journal of intelligent manufacturing	0.598	0.702

Since fabric quality, as the most important element of garment appearance, is determined by its mechanical properties, it is obvious that these properties directly impact fabric processing properties. It can be seen through various forms of fabric behaviorunder the loads that occur in sewing. Investigations of the correlations of the stress and fabric behavior are aimed at constructing a system to predict fabric behavior in garment manufacturing processes, as well as to predict the appearance of the garment to be manufactured. The investigation presented here deals with the impact of fabric mechanical properties on the quality of seam appearance, as defined by seam puckering andwork-piece flotation.

Potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that these surfactants hinder both anodic and cathodic processes, i.e. act as mixed-type inhibitors. It was found that the adsorption of the N-alkyl ammonium ion in 2 M H2SO4 solution follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Plots of log ?$[/theta$?/(1-?$/theta$?)] versus log?$c_{inh}$? yielded straight lines with a slope, which changed drasticallyat the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactants studied. Accordingly, the CMC could be accurately determined from these measurements. The calculated values of the free energy of adsorption ?$/Delta$??$G_{ads}$? are, in cases when the charge on the metal surface is negative with respect to the PZC, relatively high what is characteristically for the chemisorption. On the other hand, for positive metal surfaces it is assumed that ?$SO_4^{2-}$? anions are adsorbed first, so the cationic species would be limited by the surface concentration of anions.

The SSCP was designed using CAD and CFD tools. The performance curves of the SSCP were measured in a test facility with water involved as the working media and compared with the calculated ones. The measured performance curves are characterised by the region of hysteresis since the throttle closing performance curves do not correspond completely to the throttle opening performance curves. The deliveryhead and efficiency are abruptly decreased when reducing the flow ratefrom the point of the maximum delivery head. Due to the evident analogy ofthe SSCP and the axial-flow compressors performance curves and similarities in the rotor design it can be anticipated that such an operating behaviour of the SSCP is caused by the rotating stall phenomenon. CFD simulations confirm that the stalling of the rotor passages causes the steep delivery head drop when decreasing the flow rate from the point of maximum head.	deu	VDI-Verlag GmbH	2008	1.01	Forschung im Ingenieurwesen	0.170	0.986
10377755	Heat transfer influenced by turbulent airflow inside an axially rotating diffuser	The paper presents a study of heat transfer between the turbulent airflow and the inner wall surface of an axial diffuser rotating around its longitudinal axis. Heat transfer was assessed through the measurement of a time-dependent temperature field of the diffuser inner wall surface. Measurements of the instantaneous flow velocity components were performed by a laser-Doppler anemometry system, which delivered information on mean velocity components as well as on the turbulence intensity. A significant increase of all three mean velocity components was observed near the rotating diffuser wall in comparisonwith a non-rotating diffuser. Temperature field measurements were carried out by means of infrared thermography. The experiment showed a significant dependence of the temperature field on the turbulent flowfield induced by diffuser rotation. A strong influence of the flow separation and reattachment on the temperature distribution was observed, while rotation was found to suppress the occurrence of flow separation from the diffuser wall. Properties of the velocity field such as turbulent kinetic energy were directly coupled with the temperature distribution in order to gain the information on how to enhance or reduce heat transfer by changing the integralparameters of the diffuser (e.g. rotation frequency or amount of flow).	nld	Kluwer Academic Publishers	2008	1.01	Flow, turbulence and combustion	0.776	1.21
1037927	Shear modulus and stiffness of brickwork masonry: an experimental perspective	Masonry is a composite non-homogeneous structural material, whose mechanical properties depend on the properties of and the interaction between the composite components - brick and mortar, their volume ratio, the properties of their bond, and any cracking in the masonry. The mechanical properties of masonry depend on the orientation of the bed joints and the stress state of the joints, and so the values of the shear modulus, as well as the stiffness of masonry structural elements can depend on various factors. An extensive testing programme in several countries addressws the problem of measurement of the stiffness propertries of masonry. These testing programs have provided sufficient data to permit a review of the influence of different testing techniques (mono and bi-axial tests), the variations caused by distinct loading conditions (monotonic and cyclic), the impact of the mortar type, as well as influence of the reinforcement. This review considers the impact of the measurement device used for determining the shear modulus and stiffness of walls on the results. The results clearly indicate a need to re-assess the values stated in almost all national codes for the shear modulus of the masonry, especially for masonry made with lime mortar, where strong anisotropic behaviour is in the stiffness properties.	kor	Techno-press	2005	1.01	Structural engineering and mechanics	0.432	0.644
10380571	Modelling of residual stress profiles in plasma nitrided tool steel	Residual stresses may be present in engineering components as an unintended consequence of manufacturing processes, but they may also be introduced deliberately to beneficial effect during surface engineering procedures. Plasma nitriding and nitrocarburizing are such processes of particular importance for tool steel components used in tool, die and machine applications. These processes afford significant advantages, such as greatly improved wear and corrosion resistance, as well as fatigue strength resulting from the generation of near-surface compressive residual stresses. A precise knowledge of the level and distribution of residual stresses that exist in such engineering components is necessary for product development and quality control purposes, as well as for the accurate prediction of fatigue resistance. If located at the same depth as the Hertzian stress concentrations, compressive residual stresses can greatly improve the fatigue properties of loaded surfaces. Therefore, reliable methods for residual stressdetermination are required, with residual stress measurement techniques having their limitations. The aim of the present paper was to correlate the residual stress distribution in plasma nitrided and nitrocarburized H11 tool steel with the microhardness depth profile, in order to determine whether a relatively simple microhardness-related parameter could be used to predict the depth of the maximum compressive residual stresses, and to thereby enable optimization of the nitriding parameters for specific contact conditions.	usa	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Materials characterization	1.225	0.704

10383894	Object grating method application in strain determination on CTOD tests	Standard fracture toughness tests require standard specimens with the presumption that mechanical properties are uniform in the crack growth direction. Standards for crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) fracture tests prescribe remote crack mouth opening displacement, which can lead to inadequate results in the case of heterogeneous materials properties. This paper describes the application of an object grating method (OGM) on the fracture behaviour of a heterogeneous specimen. Fracture behaviour is described by measuring deformation on the surface of a specimen, in terms of CTOD and, consequently, by strain determination. An OGM is advantageously usedwhen measuring modified CTOD tests on two specimens with an initial crack in a macroscopic heterogeneous welded joint. Results significantly show that fracture behaviour depends on the material in the vicinity of the crack tip concerning the direction of crack propagation.	gbr	British Society for Strain Measurement	2006	1.01	Strain	0.535	0.571

10389782	A study of treating textile wastewater after reactive dye printing by using nanofitration	A synthetically-prepared reactive dye printing wastewater was subjected to nanofiltration. Except for the dye type, the basic composition of the synthetic wastewater was similar to wastewater obtained from a local textile factory in Slovenia. The dyes used were: C.I. Reactive Red 24 and C.I. Reactive Black 5. The filtrations were carried out with two nanofiltration membranes (NFT 50 and DL), which were evaluated for membrane fouling tendency, permeate flux, and their suitability in removing salt, colour and COD. All filtration experiments were conducted in a plate and frame module. For both the NFT 50 and DL membrane the permeate flux did not increase linearly with pressure due to concentration polarization. However, at all pressures the permeate flux obtained with the DL membrane were higher than with the NFT 50 membrane. The retentions, observed at transmembrane pressuresranging from 2-15 bar, showed that the highest retention values wereachieved at 10 bar. The best separation efficiency was achieved with NFT-50 membrane where permeate samples were practically colourless. The low retention of COD for both membranes was explained by the fact that smaller organic molecules such as urea, rapidoprint (nitrobenzene sulphonate) are not retained by the membrane and therefore contributes to high COD values in the permeate.	hrv	Hrvatski inenjerski savez tekstilaca	2006	1.01	Tekstil	0.085	0.597

The Quadratic model is employed to accommodate the shear-thickening behavior of corn-starch and water mixture. Numerical procedure is validated with results for the Newtonian fluid flow in a range of the Reynolds number Re=10,20,.,100. Results for the non-Newtonian fluid show that the shear-thickening behavior lowers the threshold of the transition from flow symmetry to its asymmetry (lowers the onset of the bifurcation and the critical value of the Reynolds number) and increases the reattachment length. In addition, the results for the Quadratic model are compared to the results obtained with the Power law.	nld	Elsevier Scientific Publ.

Therefore, a need for adequate methodological support and tools for modeling, structuring, and control of the next generation manufacturing systems is recognized. In this study, the adaptive distributed modeling framework for collaborative design and operations of network manufacturing systems is presented. In manufacturing networks, several autonomous partners participate in dynamic design of a manufacturing system, its implementation, and adaptation. In this context collaborative modeling, structuring, and control in distributed manufacturing environment play a vital role. The proposed modeling framework introduces the common modeling space and enables acollaborative definition of modeling building blocks, model design, simulation, and operations support of distributed manufacturing systems in a dynamic environment - which is the realistic nature of the global manufacturing.

10405398	Selection of the economic objective function for the optimization of process flow sheets	This paper highlights the problem of selecting the most suitable economic optimization criteria for mathematical programming approaches to the synthesis, design, and optimization of chemical process flow sheets or their subsystems. Minimization of costs and maximization of profit are the most frequently used economic criteria in technical papers. However, there are manyother financial measures which can lead to different optimal solutions if applied in the objective function. This paper describes the characteristics ofthe optimal solutions obtained with various optimization criteria like the total annual cost, the profit, the payback time, the equivalent annual cost, the net present worth, and the internal rate of return. It was concluded that the maximization of the net present worth (NPW) with a discount rate equal to the minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) is probably the most appropriate method for the optimization of process flow sheets or their subsystems. Similar or equal solutions can be obtained by simpler criteria of minimum equivalent annual cost or maximum profit if the annual investment cost is calculated by using the MARR instead of the straight-line depreciation method.These criteria represent a thorough compromise between quantitative andqualitative measures, because they consider the absolute terms of future cash flows of investments equally important as profitability through the life cycle of the project. The uncertainty related to the value of the MARR was considered by the generation of Pareto optimal solutions for the NPW and by the stochastic analyses of two design example problems.	nld	American Chemical Society	2006	1.01	Industrial & engineering chemistry research	1.518	0.921

As a consequence, elementary abelian groups were proved to be only possible abelian point stabilizers arising from such actions, and ?$D_8$? was shown to be only nonabelian group of order 8 with the same property. Constructing of such group actions with point stabilizers isomorphic to ?$D_8$? or to ?$\ZZ_2^h$?, ?$h\ge 1$?, were also given there. These results are extended here to include a more in depth analysis of the structure of point stabilizers of such group actions, resulting in a set of necessary conditions allowing us to obtain a restricted list of 19 possible candidates for point stabilizers of such group actions when the point stabilizers have order ?$2^h$?, ?$h\le 8$?. (For ?$h\le 5$?, this list gives a complete classification of such point stabilizers).

10418966	Electrohydraulic pressure control by a self-adjusting proportional derivative controller	The main characteristic of an electrohydraulic pump control system is the presence of an electrical signal path. It requires at least one sensor for the controlled value (in this case pressure), delivering feedback to be compared with the electrical or numerical reference in the controller. The additonal expense penalty for the sensor and the valve is offset by the advantage of flexibility in the structure and parameters of the controller in comparison to hydraulic - mechanical concepts. Thus, the transfer response can be adapted to demands, even in the operational state. Sophisticated control structures can be implemented easily in the form of computer or microcontroller programs. The layout of electrohydraulic pressure control discussed in this study includes the presented loading unit. The variable pump is designed to act together with a proportional valve having two metering edges. It is less expensive compared to the design with a synchronizing cylinder and four metering edges. However, only inferior static and dynamic performance can be expected. Hydraulic energy is supplied to the control valve directly from the output port of the pump - with the advantage of simple assembly, as there are no additional components required - but with the drawback that there is influence on the control loop`s properties at every change in the disturbance value or reference. The aim of the study presented in this paper is a more efficient and simple concept compared to other known methods for pressure control of the above mentioned pump including the dynamics of the distribution network, and also the characteristics of the hydraulic load with special focus on improvements in steady state and dynamic behaviour.	usa	Society for Experimental Stress Analysis	2006	1.01	Experimental techniques	0.274	0.741

The influence of biodiesel is studied by running experiments on an NA diesel bus engine MAN D2 2566 with a direct-injection M system. The fuel used is biodiesel produced from rapeseed. Special attention is focused on the determination of the optimal injection-pump timing with respect to engine harmful emissions, enginefuel consumption, and other engine performance parameters. These engine characteristics are compared against those obtained using conventional D2 diesel. Experiments with biodiesel and D2 are run on several engine operating regimes.

With the help of a simple theory, we explained the step-like motion of the rod's free end. This theory conforms well with the general shape of the measured displacement history curve. The acquired momentum can be directly estimated by measuring the height of a step from the step-like motion of the rod's end. Measurements based on an arm-compensated Michelson interferometer also enabled us to follow the attenuation of an ultrasonic wave and so to determine the characteristic attenuation time. This quantity plays a major role in the transfer of linear momentum from within the initial ultrasonic wave to the final net uniform motion of the specimen.	deu	Springer	2008	1.01	Applied physics	1.884	1.953

Geometry specific parameters (flatness of the particular surface region, average deviation of the measured points and height of the surface defects) are calculated from the acquired surface data and then checked whether/how they fit within the tolerances specified in a technical documentation. The method has been tested in the laboratory by examination of a sample of castings taken randomly from the production process. A comparison of the results obtained by this method and by a qualified operator has shown good agreement.	gbr	IOP Publishing	2008	1.01	Measurement science & technology	1.493	1.044
1043295	Heat affected zone in surfacing chromium ledeburitic steel	Tools get failured during work; wear is a major factor that contributes to failures. Damaged tools are replaced or filed. This paper describes typical changes that occur in the heat affected zone of tool (HAZ), which was repaired by surfacing with a TIG and with micro-plasma procedure. Microstructure of the steel on the repaired tool was analysed by an optical and scanning electron microscope. The tool was made of chromium ledeburitic steel type W.N. 1.2379 and it was repaired by surfacing steel type W.N. 1.4718. Changes in the HAZ also depend on the type of surfacing. Besides microstructural changes, dissolution of carbides, especially primary carbides. This way the concentration of the carbide-forming elements and carbonis increased in the base around the primary carbides in the HAZ so the result is so-called secondary eutectic or secondary ledeburite.	hrv	Metalurki fakultet;Hrvatsko metalurko drutvo	2010	1.01	Metalurgija	0.348	0.709
10438683	Influence of absorption mechanisms on laser-induced plasma plume	In modelling laser-induced plasma plume formation, the proper description of laser absorption in the plasma plays an important role. In the present model, absorption is described by means of three different mechanisms: inverse bremsstrahlung (IB), photoionization (PI) and absorption by small condensed clusters. Numerical solutions of the model are given for KrF laser beam irradiation (wavelength l=248 nm) impinging on a nickel target at various fluences. The influence of particular absorption mechanisms on the absorbed laser beam energy in the plasma plume during the pulse is shown for different fluences. Using all three absorption mechanisms, the calculated plasma properties show good agreement with the experimental results of other authors.	nld	North-Holland	2008	1.01	Applied Surface Science	1.576	1.081
10438939	Improved modelling of the loading spectra using a mixture model approach	In order to perform a fatigue-life analysis of structures the parameters of the structure loading spectra must be assessed. If the load time series are counted using a two-parametric rainflow counting method, the structure loading spectrum provides a probability for the occurrence of a load-cycle with certain amplitude and mean values. It is beneficial for the prediction of the fatigue life to describe the loading spectrum by a continuous function. We have previously discovered that mixtures of Gaussian probability density functions can be used to model the loading spectra. The main problems of this approach that have not been satisfactorily resolved before are related to the estimation of the number of components in the applied mixture models, and to the modelling of the load-cycle distributions with relatively fat tails. In this article, we describe a method for estimating the parameters of mixture models, which allows automatic determination of the number of components in a mixture model. The presented method is applied for modelling simulated and measured loading spectra using mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian or t probability density functions. In the article we also show that the mixture of t probability density functions sometimes better describes the loading spectra than the mixture of Gaussian probability density functions.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Limited	2008	1.01	International journal of fatigue	1.556	0.986

The striation on the surface cut with AWJ is a characteristic phenomena which is strongly present when cutting with high traverse velocities for particular material type and thickness of workpiece. The connection between the cutting front step formation and striation formation is explained through series of experiments, which include visual observations of cutting transparent material and through analogies, which deal with river meandering and wear of pneumatic conveyor bends.	che	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Wear	1.509	0.986

The assumption of preserving commutativity can be reformulated as preserving zero Lie products. So, this theorem is an extension of the well-known result on the structure of Lie homomorphisms of matrix algebras. We first prove the result for the special case in which ?$F$? is the complex field and then apply the transfer principle in Model Theoretic Algebra to extend it to the general case.	nld	North-Holland	2001	1.01	Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra	0.428	0.48

The research is based on sigma (s) and beta (b) convergence of per capita GDP among the 10 countries which joined the European Union in 2004. Our results confirm the existence of both types of convergence in the second half of the 1990s and the 2000s. Generally, the poorer new EU member states grew faster than the richer new EU member states. As a result, the income gap between these two groups of countries has narrowed although it still remains quite large. The convergence occurred at the rate of 4.2% during the period 1992-2006 and 7.0% and 9.6% during the sub-periods 1995-2006 and 2002-06 respectively.	gbr	Carfax	2010	1.01	Post-communist economies	0.362	1.022

I argue that what appears to be emerging in post Milosevic Serbia is a new articulation and a new scale of belonging. Most of my informants are mobilising their city identities, moving from a national to an urban perspective. They imaginatively defend their city identity through a discourse that 'others' its newcomers, i.e. the rural residents. However, the article is critical of their articulated dichotomous rhetoric of 'Us, the City Cosmopolitans' vs. 'Them, the Rural Nationalists: My overall aim is to offer an analysis of the Serbian case, where one sees that the city of Belgrade has become a microcosm and a symbolic expression for modernity, resistance, openness and democracy. However, instead of seeing urbanity as the only locus of modernity, one needs to understand that urbanity does not one dimensionally lead to the urbanisation of the mind, implying that once you have cities, or live in a city, there is a specific urban, cosmopolitan experience.	gbr	Taylor&Francis	2005	1.01	Journal of ethnic and migration studies	0.485	0.41

Superstructure, detailed modeling equations, and solutions of example problems are presented. The predominantly linear character of the model can be kept as long as single-component mass exchange network synthesis problems and packed columns as mass exchangers are considered. At the cost of introducing nonlinear constraints, the optimizationmodel can be extended to handle multicomponent problems and stagedcolumns as well. The new model applies the key ideas of the simultaneous heat exchanger network synthesis model of Yee and Grossmann [Comput. Chem.

Surface temperature distribution on a rotating blade was measured by means of infrared thermography. The experimental facility, IR thermography method, and the CFD numerical model that was made according to the actual test rig geometry and operating conditions, are described in detail. For the present study, tests were carried out at relatively low fluid temperatures in several operating points, defined by rotational, Reynolds and hot-to-cool air mass flow ratio. Experimental and numerical results for the observed blade side are compared in terms of surface temperature distribution (2D) and 1D charts along the blade midspan. Temperature distributions are statistically evaluated and show very good agreement.	deu	VDI-Verlag GmbH	2008	1.01	Forschung im Ingenieurwesen	0.170	0.986

The method is based on discrete convolution by using convolution masks and point anchoring in the pixel. The use of ordinary convolution distorts the curve shape and gives large errors in length calculation. The advantage of anchoring is that it limits the point shifting into the pixel during the calculation of the curve length. The method is applied to an analytical arc and various calculations are performed.

10484507	A study of the horizontal inertial forces acting on the suspended load of slewing cranes	When designing a crane's load-carrying structures, a static analysis is still central to a preliminary determination of the dimensions required. However, tobring the results of these calculations closer to reality, different quasi-static procedures are introduced. These procedures take account of various dynamic effects by means of appropriate coefficients. In this paper, anew procedure is proposed for determining the maximum horizontal inertial forces in a radial direction that are acting on a load suspended from the jib during a crane's slewing motion. Based on a previously developed and verified mathematical model of a general-type slewing crane, we undertook the following. Firstly, we verified that the horizontal inertial forces in the radial direction are of no less importance (no smaller in terms of their magnitude) than the forces in the tangential direction, and that their maximumvalues can easily be a few times greater than the nominal centrifugal force. Based on this we introduced a new coefficient of radial horizontal inertial force, and we calculated a diagram for the rapid determination of this coefficient. We also present a brief report of the horizontal inertial forces in the tangential direction.	gbr	Pergamon Press	2008	1.01	International journal of mechanical sciences	1.077	0.986

The influence of the main tool trajectory on the forming outcome in WJISMF is observed and optimized in order to reduce the forming time and improve the product quality. Laminated tools are fabricated with abrasive water jet (AWJ) machining from aluminium plates of different thicknesses. The parts formed in this investigation are measured with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) and results are compared by means of forming time, parts symmetry and achieved geometry, which is defined with the supporting tool.	gbr	IFS Publications	2008	1.01	International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	0.743	0.905

Due to their nanodimensions, the particles had a primitive cubic (pc) structure rather than the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure of the bulk material. An examination of the synthesis from the reverse micelle reveals that the morphology of the iron-nickel alloy nanoparticles depends mainly on the microemulsion`s composition. The magnetization of the nanoparticles was much lower than that of the bulk material, reflecting the influence of the nanodimensions on the particlesæ magnetizations.	nld	North-Holland Publishing Co	2006	1.01	Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials	1.212	1.659

The rotational speed was reduced by using the theory of dynamical similarity where water was used as a flow medium instead of air. Numerical simulations were performed by using compressible and incompressible fluids. Flow through impeller channels is presented as particle trajectories and relative velocities for experimental approach and as flow streamlines and relative velocities for numerical approach.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

The SCARA is controlled and teleoperated via the internet. Presented experiment isused by students at the University of Maribor as a remote educational tool. Application is based on MATLAB/Simulink and LabVIEW software packages. MATLAB/Simulink and developed library DSP-2 Library for Simulink are used for neural network control algorithm development, simulation and code generation. The executable code is downloaded to the Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The DSP controls through the analog and digital I/O the real process and maintain the data connection with the laboratory server. The LabVIEW virtual instrument(VI) is used as a client server application for the teleoperation. LabVIEW VI provides the ability for parameter tuning, signal monitoring, on-line analysis and via Remote Panels technology also teleoperation by using the internet browser (Internet Explorer). The main advantage of a neural network controller is the exploitation of its self-learning capability. For example: when friction or an unexpected disturbance occurs, the user of a remote application does not need any information about the changed robot dynamics, because it is estimated independently of the remote user.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

Coordinate values of point cloud distributed at a particular surface were used as a surface properties descriptor, which was fedinto SOKN where representative neurons for curvature, slope and spatial surface properties were established. On the basis of this approach, the surface patch boundaries were reorganized in such a manner that the finished machining strategies gave the best possible surface roughness results. The patch boundaries were constructed in accordance with the Gaussian and mean curvature, in order to achieve a smooth transition between patches, and in this way, preserve or even improve the desired curve and surface continuities (C2 and G2). It is shown that by reorganization of the boundaries in respect of curvature, slope and spatial point distribution, the surface quality of the finished free-form surface is improved. This approach was experimentally verified on 22 free-form models which were reorganized by SOKN and machined with finish milling tool-path strategies. The results show rather good improvement of the mean surface roughness profile Ra for reorganized surfaces, when compared with unorganized surfaces.	gbr	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	1.143	0.905

This study illustrates the use of the ICF in vocational rehabilitation and disability assessment in Slovenia. Method. A review of the Slovenian law about vocational rehabilitation was performed. A survey was developed and group and individual interviews were conducted with professionals involved in vocational rehabilitation who use the ICF. Results. The vast majority of the respondents believe that ICF helps to create a commonlanguage for multidisciplinary communication. The main advantages of theICF identified by the respondents are that it provides a holistic view of the person, assesses complexities of functioning, provides a unified language and offers a quick and easy insight into functioning. The disadvantages of ICF are complicated terminology and subjectivity of the assessor. A difficulty encountered by the users is that by law, only body functions of the ICF are assessed. Additional qualitative analysis of the users' understanding of ICF and its purpose revealed heterogeneity. Significant differences between public and private organisations were found. Conclusion. ICF is a promising tool for use in vocational rehabilitation and disability assessment in Slovenia. A major challenge is the lack of interface between ICF and policies on vocational rehabilitation in Slovenia.	gbr	Taylor & Francis	2011	1.01	Disability and rehabilitation	1.498	1.201
10511643	An improved three-dimensional coupled fluid-structure model for Coriolis flowmeters	The paper presents a coupled numerical model built to simulate the operation of Coriolis flowmeters, which exploit the alteration of the vibration mode shape of the measuring tube for the mass flow rate measurement. The explained measuring effect is a consequence of the interaction between the motion of thetube, vibrating at its natural frequency, and the fluid flow in it. The numerical model is realized by coupling of a finite volume (FV) code for fluid flow analysis with a finite element (FE) code for structural analysis using the conventional staggered solution procedure, with added inner iterations to achieve strong coupling. The simulation algorithm is divided into two steps. A free vibration of the measuring tube considered in the firststep is complemented in the second step, after the numerical free vibration response is properly stabilized, with the harmonic excitation force actuating the measuring tube at its resonant frequency of several hundreds of Hertz to resemble the operation of actual Coriolis flowmeters. Different scenarios using zero-order or three-point fluid load predictor and soft application of the fluid load in the initial stages of the simulation are compared to yield a simulation strategy, which will minimize the time needed to obtain the stabilized steady-state response of the vibrating measuring tube. The proposed simulation procedure was applied on a straight-tube Coriolis flowmeter and used for the estimation of the velocity profile effect.The results exhibit sufficient stability (low scatter) to be used for the estimation of sensitivity variations of order of magnitude around tenths of a percent.	gbr	Academic Press	2008	1.01	Journal of fluids and structures	1.380	0.986
10511899	Generalized renewal process for repairable systems based on finite Weibull mixture	Repairable systems can be brought to one of possible states following a repair. These states are: 'as good as new', 'as bad as old' and 'better than old but worse than new'. The probabilistic models traditionally used to estimate the expected number of failures account for the first two states, butthey do not properly apply to the last one, which is more realistic in practice. In this paper, a probabilistic model that is applicable to all of the three after-repair states, called generalized renewal process (GRP), is applied. Simplistically, GRP addresses the repair assumption by introducing the concept of virtual age into the stochastic point processes to enable them to represent the full spectrum of repair assumptions. The shape of measured ordesign life distributions of systems can vary considerably, and therefore frequently cannot be approximated by simple distribution functions. The scope of the paper is to prove that a finite Weibull mixture, with positive component weights only, can be used as underlying distribution of the time to first failure (TTFF) of the GRP model, on condition that the unknown parameters can be estimated. To support the main idea, three examples are presented. In order to estimate the unknown parameters of the GRP model with m-fold Weibull mixture, the EM algorithm is applied. The GRP model with m mixture components distributions is compared to the standard GRP model based on two-parameter Weibull distribution by calculating the expected number of failures. It can be concluded that the suggested GRP model with Weibull mixture with an arbitrary but finite number of components is suitable for predicting failures based on the past performance of the system.	gbr	Elsevier Applied Science	2008	1.01	Reliability engineering & systems safety	1.379	1.018

To describe functioning and disability in patients with stroke according to the model endorsed by the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) in a rehabilitation hospital. Methods.Adult patients with stroke were consecutively enrolled. The FunctionalIndependence Measure (FIM) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS II) were administered in individual sessions. ICF checklist was applied on the basis of medical documentation and rehabilitationteam meetings. Descriptive analyses were performed to report on FIM and WHO-DAS II scores. ICF categories reported as a problem by more than 20% of patients were described in detail. Results. Patients (197 in total) were mainly men, aged about 60, with average FIM score of 75. Within ICF Body Functions component 32 categories were applied in at least 20% of the patients, 5 within Body Structures, 27 within Activities and Participation and 7 within Environmental Factors. Conclusions. ICF represents a new integrative tool to help professionals dealing with stroke. The checklist captures the various sequels of stroke in terms of impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. It shows the extensive need for rehabilitation, whereby it facilitates consideration of the patient' needs.	gbr	Taylor & Francis	2010	1.01	Disability and rehabilitation	1.489	1.126

Substrate specificities of model substrates (wool with partiallyremoved cuticles treated with SDS) were analyzed by protein release, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen analysis. The CN ratio of released material turned out to be a good parameter to determine the site of action of proteases on fibres. Compared to other enzymes, the fungal protease preferentially hydrolyzed cuticle scales and has thus a potential for anti-shrinking pre-treatment of wool fabrics.	deu	Science and Technology Letters	2006	1.01	Biotechnology letters	1.134	2.589
1051753	A method for selection of appropriate assistive technology for computer acces	Assistive technologies (ATs) for computer access enable people with disabilities to be included in the information society. Current methods for assessment and selection of the most appropriate AT for each individual are nonstandardized, lengthy, subjective, and require substantial clinical experience of a multidisciplinary team. This manuscript presents and evaluates an objective approach to test and select an appropriate AT for computer access for people with disabilities. Six user interfaces (standard keyboard, mini and large joystick, mini and large trackball, and head-operatedmouse and keyboard) were tested on the control group of 29 peoplewithout disabilities and on 63 people with neuromuscular and muscular diseases, using purpose-built software for testing the speed of sentence typing. Different criteria for selecting the optimal AT were tested and compared with the skilled clinician's choice. The learning curves of the people with disabilities proved to follow those of the healthy controls, but with lower performance. Daily computer use was not associated with AT selection, but corresponded nearly perfectly to the level of functional ability of upper limbs. Agreement between clinician's choice and learning-based AT selection was noteworthy, but far from perfect. If partial agreement was taken into account, that is, AT was considered as an ordinal variable based on the corresponding functional ability level, and the second best learning-based choice was taken into account, the agreement was high for highest median typing speed as AT selection criterion. In conclusion, the developed method for AT assessment and selection seems to be an efficient guide for an unskilled clinician to choose an appropriate AT.	usa	Lipincott Williams & Wilkins	2010	1.01	International journal of rehabilitation research	1.192	1.126
10517782	Numerical analysis of injection characteristics using biodiesel fuel	This paper deals with numerical analysis of injection process using biodieselmineral diesel fuel blends with the aim to search for the potentialsto reduce engine harmful emissions. The considered fuels are neat biodiesel from rapeseed oil and its blends with mineral diesel D2. For the numerical analysis a one-dimensional mathematical model is employed. In order to model accurately the investigated fuels, the employed empirical expressionsfor their properties are determined by experiments. To verify the mathematical model and the empirical expressions, experiments and numerical simulation are run on a mechanical control diesel fuel injection M system at several operating regimes. Injection process at many different operating regimes and using several fuel blends are then investigated numerically. Attention is focused on the injection characteristics, especially on fuelling,fuelling at some stage of injection, mean injection rate, mean injection pressure, injection delay and injection timing, which influence the most important engine characteristics. The analysis of the obtained results reveals that, while keeping engine performance within acceptable limits, harmful emissions can be reduced by adjusting appropriately pump injection timing in dependence on the biodiesel content. This prediction is also confirmed experimentally.	gbr	Elsevier	2006	1.01	Fuel	1.358	0.921
1052009	Validation of the ""World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS-2"" in patients with chronic diseases	Background: The WHODAS-2 is a disability assessment instrument based on the conceptual framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). It provides a global measure of disability and 7 domain-specific scores. The aim of this study was to assess WHODAS-2 conceptual model and metric properties in a set of chronic and prevalent clinical conditions accounting for a wide scope of disability in Europe. Methods: 1,119 patients with one of 13 chronic conditions were recruited in 7 European centres. Participants were clinically evaluated and administered the WHODAS-2 and the SF-36 at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months of follow-up. The latent structure was explored and confirmed by factor analysis (FA). Reliability was assessed in terms of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients, ICC). Construct validity was evaluated by correlating the WHODAS-2 and SF-36 domains, and comparing known groups based on the clinicalseverity and work status. Effect size (ES) coefficient was used to assess responsiveness. To assess reproducibility and responsiveness, subsamples of stable (at 6 weeks) and improved (after 3 moths) patients were defined, respectively, according to changes in their clinical-severity. Results: The satisfactory FA goodness of fit indexes confirmed a second order factor structure with 7 dimensions, and a global score for the WHODAS-2. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.77 (self care) to 0.98 (life activities: work or school), and the ICC was lower, but achieved the recommended standard of 0.7 for four domains. Correlations between global WHODAS-2 score and the different domains of the SF-36 ranged from -0.29 to -0.65. Most of the WHODAS-2 scores showed statistically significant differences among clinical-severity groups for all pathologies, and between working patients and those not working due to ill health (p < 0.001). Among the subsample of patients who had improved, responsiveness coefficients were small to moderate (ES = 0.3-0.7), but higher than those of the SF-36. Conclusions: The latent structure originally designed by WHODAS-2 developers has been confirmed for the first time, and it has shown good metric properties in clinic and rehabilitation samples. Therefore, considerable support is provided to the WHODAS-2 utilization as an international instrument to measure disability based on the ICF model.	gbr	BioMed Central	2010	1.01	Health and quality of life outcomes	1.860	1.579
1052296	The effect of beta-glucanase alone and in combination with xylanase on the nutritive value of diets based on barley of low or high viscosity in broiler chickens	An experiment was conducted to study the effect of [beta]-glucanase alone and in combination with xylanase on energy value, nutirent utilization and intestinal viscosity in broiler chickens fed with diets based on barley of low or high viscosity. Barley samples were selected out of ten samples collected from different regions in Slovenia, according to the most different extract viscosity. A total of 48 twentyone-day old, individually caged, male broiler chicks were used in balance experiments. The animals received one of the barley based diets prepared with one of the two barley samples. Both diets remained unsupplemented or were either supplemented with [beta]-glucanase alone (160 [beta]GU/kg) or [beta]-glucanse and xylanase (160 [beta]GU/kg + 2800 XU/kg). The results of the experiment confirmed the improvement in nutrient utilization (dry matter, nitrogen), in terms of an increase in the energy value of the feed and in reduction of intestinal viscosity, resulting from the addition of enzymes. Hovewer, the results also clearly showed diffrences between the two barley samples based diets in their response to different enzyme treatments, where only diets based on high extract viscosity barley showed significant results. Futhermore, the results clearly indicated that in order to achieve significant improvement in the dry matter, nitrogen and energy utilization of barley based diets, the addition of [beta]-glucanase alone was not always sufficient. As a consequence, the combination of both [beta]-glucanase and xylanase may be advised.	deu	Ulmer	2000	1.01	Archiv für Geflügelkunde	0.374	0.627
10523675	Influence of blade deformation on integral characteristic of axial flow fan	Axial flow fan blades deform during operation due to the various forces that act on them. That is why, we can ask ourselves about the influence of the blade deformation on the integral and local characteristics. In the paper, we present a study of influence of axial flow fan blade deformation. The paper deals with measurements of the blade deformation at the known integral working conditions. Results - deformations of fan blade tip were used for numerical study of the influence of the changed blade form on the fan's aerodynamic characteristic. Fan integral characteristics were measured in accordance with the ISO-DIS 5801:2006 standard and were carried out on the wind tunnel of the Hidria Institute Klima, Godovie. Other measurements of the blade deformation were done on the measuring station on the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, with the help of computer aided visualization. Deformations were measured in three working points, whichwere defined with fan integral parameters. Results of the measurements helped to determine modified form of the blade, which was then used for the numerical simulation for the same fan integral parameters. The study of deformation influence, based on the numerical simulation, was carried out.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986
10523931	The performance and mechanisms of DLC-coated surfaces in contact with steel in boundary-lubrication conditions	The importance of hard coatings in mechanical applications has been increasing rapidly for more than 20 years. The development of novel coatings, such as improved ceramic, diamond-like-carbon and advanced nano-composites, has promoted scientific research in the field of tribology and surface engineering, and at the same time it has focussed attention on micro- and nano-technologies. Diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings are becoming one of the most promising types of hard coatings. Their main advantages are low friction,good anti-wear properties, and adhesive protection. However, due to their low surface energy their reactivity with conventional oils and additivesis limited and remains unsatisfactory. For a qualitative step-change that would improve the performance and allow effective optimising and tailoring of boundary-lubricated DLC contacts for various mechanical systems it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of why, how, under which conditions, and with which types of DLC coatings and lubricants the actual boundary lubrication is possible. As a result of ten years of research in this field, a lot of data have been reported: however, due to the different types of coatings, lubricants and additives used in these studies, the results are often difficult to compare and are sometimes contradictory. As a result of the recent heavy demand from many industries to apply DLC coatings to lubricated systems, a much better understanding of these phenomena and their overall performance is required. Therefore, if we wish to see a more effective continuation of the research and a better understanding of the scattered results, an overview of the current state of the art of lubricated DLC contacts is needed. In this paper we analyse the performance and suggested boundary-lubrication mechanisms of DLC/steel contacts from already-published studies and we summarise our present understanding of the boundary lubrication in DLC/steel contacts, which complements our recent analyses of DLC/DLC contacts.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.02	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

10526235	Dispersion of an optodynamic wave during its multiple transitions in a rod	A rod acquires linear momentum during a short-laser-pulse ablation of its front face. Initially, this momentum is localized within the propagating laser-induced mechanical pulse-the optodynamic wave-while later it is gradually transferred to the uniform motion of the entire rod. Among other effects, the dispersion of the optodynamic wave due to lateral inertia plays an important role in the linear-momentum transformation mechanism. We observed the dispersion using interferometric measurements of the rod's rear-end staircaselike displacement. The displacements calculated using an analytical solution of Love's equation for a laser-ablated free-free homogeneous rod agree well with our measured data.	usa	American Institute of Physics.	2008	1.01	Applied physics letters	3.726	2.251

10528795	Impact of Young's modulus degradation on springback calculation in steel sheet drawing	The aim of the paper is to demonstrate, based on the results of respective numerical simulations of a drawing process, how springback of a steel sheet drawn part is affected by stiffness degradation, which results from the material damage evolved during the forming process. For the purpose of the presented paper the GTN (Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman) damage constitutive modelcoupled with Mori-Tanaka approach has been implemented in ABAQUS/Explicitvia VUMAT user material subroutine, while integration of the constitutive model is performed with a numerical scheme developed recently by the authors. Parameters of the constitutive model are identified, for authenticity of the paper, from the measurement data obtained from classical tensile tests of cold rolled stainless steel EN 1.4301, as well as from the measured stiffness degradation, as a function of the plastic strain. From a comparative analysis of numerical results of the springback behaviour, investigated on the Demeri springback cup test under assumption of different constitutive models, it can be concluded, that stiffness degradation should be incorporated in simulations of sheet metal forming. Its influence on a predicted final shape of a steel sheet drawn part is namely too significant tobe neglected.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

10529307	The analysis of complex tribological system of single point incremental sheet metal forming - SPIF	In contemporary industrial production the ecological aspects have increasingly important role in selection of sheet metal forming process. To produce sheet metal parts with minimal environmental burdening the shortening of forming processes including the procedures for production of appurtenant forming tools as well as decrease use of lubricant is prerequisite. In general, majority of the sheet metal forming processes demand use of lubricants with oils involving additives, which are hazardous for several reasons. Therefore, the paper is focused towards the analysis of different manners of lubrication (dry contact, liquid lubricant and hard coatings) and to investigate tribological properties during a single point incremental forming (SPIF) technology, which is nowadays very attractive and manly used for small and medium batch production. The first phase of the evaluation was performed on a model test rig by simulating single point incremental forming process, where the coefficient of friction was recorded and compared as a function of lubrication method used. In addition, the paper presents the forming tool temperature measurements for three different manners of lubrication, arising from friction during the single point incremental formingof the pyramid-shaped part.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986
10529558	Dioxins and dioxin-like persistent organic pollutants in textiles and chemicals in the textile sector	Over ?$7x10^5$? tons of dyestuff is produced annually with more than 100.000 commercially available dyes. Synthesis of colorants involves a relatively large group of chemicals with complex syntheses. During the synthesis of colorants, highly toxic, cancerogenic and persistent organic compounds, such as dioxins, can be formed. Dioxins are related to halogenes, chlorine and bromine homologues being the most toxic and persistent. About 40% of globally used colorants contain organically bound chlorine. The use of colorants in textile industry, with their wide applications and complex chemistry could be a significant source of dioxins and/or precursor compounds for the formation of dioxins and other persistent organic pollutants. The aim of the paper is to give an overview of the dioxin-like compounds in chemicals, with emphasis on colorants, textiles and their fate in the environment.	hrv	Hrvatsko kemijsko drutvo	2006	1.02	Croatica chemica acta	0.778	2.094
10529563	Robust design of forming processes	Properties of raw materials (sheet metal, bars, etc.) used in forming processes are not constant. Other input parameters of forming system (friction conditions, machine settings, temperature, etc.) also scatter considerably during production. Improvement of production processes has always been an important goal in metal forming industry. The aim is to develop cost effective and stabile forming processes where the number of non-conforming products (scrap) is reduced to the minimum. In the first part of the paper an approach is described which enables the user to predict how the scatter of input parameters would influence the final properties of the products. In the second part of the paper the developed approach is used for optimization of forming process with respect to uncontrollable scatter of input parameters with the aim of minimizing scrap ratio. Optimization is basedon the use of numerical simulations, response surface methodology and stochastic optimization. It can be performed in the early stage of the production process development cycle. The presented approach was successfully applied in industrial environment during development of technology for forming of various work pieces.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

An efficient windowed peak-to-peak signal processing algorithm was developed to examine the relation between the detected signals and the engraving quality. The results of signal analysis were compared to the engraving surface topography, measured by means of optical microscopy with extended depth-of-field digital photography. The results show that it is possible to distinguish between shallow, good, and burnt engravings by examination of the acquired sonic signals.

The research explores how firms should frame their cross-border physical flows of goods and the configuration of their value-adding processes for taking advantage of diagonal cumulation of origin. The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth case study of effects of the 'SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin' on changes in the transaction cost structure of a selected Slovenian firm operating within the household-appliance sector in one of the Western Balkan Countries. Based on eligibility of local subsidiary for using origin of goods in its import/exporttransactions the cost calculations were made for its products and then three different business scenarios were developed for showing the effects of the mechanism on transaction cost changes of a firm. The paper concludes that, at the conceptual level, the mechanism of diagonal cumulation of origin may serve as an effective institutional cross-border trade-promoting tool.	hrv	Sveuèilite u Rijeci, Ekonomski fakultet	2010	1.01	Zbornik radova Ekonomskog fakulteta u Rijeci	0.111	1.022
10543643	Formation of linear momentum in a rod during a laser pulse-matter interaction	Recently, we developed an optodynamic experimental technique that makes it possible to measure the linear momentum obtained by a metal target sample in the shape of a rod during a nanosecond laser pulse interaction in the ablativeregime. The height of the rodæs rear end axial step-like displacement,caused by the first reflection of the laser-generated ultrasonic wave, is proportional to the linear momentum acquired by the rod. In comparison with commonly used ballistic methods, we can determine the acquiredmomentum on a much shorter time scale corresponding to the wave transition time, from the front to the rear end of the rod. Using this method we investigated the ambient air pressure dependence on the formation of linearmomentum over a laser intensity range, from the ablation threshold to values about ten times higher. Steel rods of various diameters were used to demonstrate the effect of an expanding blast wave which delivers additional momentum to the target, when the laser beam on the target surface is smaller than the target itself. The typical value of the acquired target momentum is on the order of mN/s and 10 mNs/J for the momentum coupling coefficient.	deu	Springer	2008	1.01	Applied physics	1.884	1.953

10549782	Two-dimensional velocity-vorticity based LES for the solution of natural convection in a differentially heated enclosure by wavelet transform based BEM and FEM	A wavelet transform based boundary element method (BEM) numerical scheme is proposed for the solution of the kinematics equation of the velocity-vorticityformulation of Navier-Stokes equations. FEM is used to solve the kinetics equations. The proposed numerical approach is used to perform two-dimensional vorticity transfer based large eddy simulation on grids with 105 nodes. Turbulent natural convection in a differentially heated enclosure of aspect ratio 4 for Rayleigh number values Ra=107-109 is simulated. Unstable boundary layer leads to the formation of eddies in the downstream parts of both vertical walls. At the lowest Rayleigh number value an oscillatory flow regime is observed, while the flow becomes increasingly irregular, non-repeating, unsymmetric and chaotic at higher Rayleigh number values. The transition to turbulence is studied with time series plots, temperature-vorticity phase diagrams and with power spectra. The enclosure is found to be only partially turbulent, what is qualitatively shown with second order statistics-Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent heat fluxes and temperature variance. Heat transfer is studied via the average Nusselt number value, its time series and its relationship to the Rayleigh number value.	gbr	Elsevier	2006	1.01	Engineering analysis with boundary elements	0.883	0.746

10552091	Parameter identification of the fatique-testing rig	In this paper the dynamic parameter identification of the novel fatigue-testing rig is presented. The applied identification method assumes a priori a simple dynamical model for which parameters are identified through free and forced vibration tests. The rig is comprised of two base excited oscillators providing the dynamic excitation for a fatigue sample and two pneumatic actuators preventing a loss of contact between the oscillators and the sample. The actuators introduce strong nonlinearities. All parameters of the system apart from the pneumatic actuators identified through the free vibration tests using the linear model were in a good agreement with those obtained by the frequency analysis. Two models, a linear and the nonlinear with Coulomb friction, were dynamically interrogated by a random excitation. It was shown that the stiffness coefficient a, increases linearly with the pressure in the pneumatic cylinders, and the viscous damping coefficient b increases quadratically with the air pressure in the pneumatic cylinders. The predicted responses for the linear and nonlinear models correlate well with the experimental data.	gbr	Pergamon Press	2008	1.01	International journal of mechanical sciences	1.077	0.986
10558235	Predicting order lead times	Entering on market, companies confront with different problems. But the largest problems of today's time are too long lead times of orders. A client that wants a particular product to be made will select the best bidder considering on delivery time. To make a bid just on the basis of experience of employees is very risky nowadays. Therefore we propose a procedure by which - on the basis of actual lead times of orders processed in the company's workplaces in the past - expected lead times of planned (and indirectly - production) orders can be predicted. The result of the proposed procedure is an empirical distribution of possible lead times for the new order, and on the basis of this distribution it is possible to predict the most probable leadtime of a new order. Using the proposed procedure, the sales department can make a prediction for the customer about delivery time of the planned order. As an illustration of the procedure for predicting lead times of orders, a case study is presented: lead time of order for the ""tool for manufacturing the filter housing"" was predicted; the tool is manufactured in the Slovenian company ETI Ltd.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

10564892	A cost performance analysis of transport infrastructure construction in Slovenia	Due to limited data availability only a few studies have been able to provide statistically significant evidence on cost overruns in transport infrastructure investments and their systematic nature, and fewer still for road infrastructure investments. The body of available evidence refers to the most economically developed countries, while very little evidence was found regarding other countries. In this article the authors focus on cost performance of road infrastructure constructed through the National Motorway Construction Programme in Slovenia. Methodologically the study departs from other studies in this field by building on detailed expenditure data and not aggregate reports from the relevant institution. This enabled the analysis of four individual project cost categories (construction cost, land acquisition damages and others) and comparably more accurate results. A representative sample of randomly selected completed projects in the period 1995-2007 revealed that the cost overruns (19%; SD = 46.10%) in the entire period studied do not appear to be higher than in other comparable studies. At the same time the study results showed that cost overruns were unstable, i.e. much higher for older projects.	nld	Nijhoff	2012	1.01	Transportation	1.023	0.895
10568214	Case study of the sonochemical decolouration of textile azo dye Reactive Black 5	The decolouration and mineralization of reactive dye C.I. Reactive Black 5, a well-known representative of non-biodegradable azo dyes, by means of ultrasonic irradiation at 20, 279 and 817 kHz has been investigated with emphasis on the effect of various parameters on decolouration and degradation efficiency. Characterization of the used ultrasound systems was performed using calorimetric measurements and oxidative species monitoring using Fricke and iodine dosimeter. Experiments were carried out with low frequency probe type, and a high-frequency plate type transducer at 50, 100 and 150 W of acoustic power and within the 5-300 mgL initial dye concentration range. Decolouration, as well as radical production, increased with increasing frequency, acoustic power, and irradiation time. Any increase in initial dye concentration results in decreased decolouration rates. Sonochemical decolouration was substantially depressed by the addition of 2-methyl-2-propanol as a radical scavenger, which suggests radical-induced reactions in the solution. Acute toxicity to marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri was tested before and after ultrasound irradiation. Under the conditions employed in this study, no toxic compounds were detected after 6 h of irradiation. Mineralization of the dye was followed by TOC measurements. Relatively low degradation efficiency (50% after 6 h of treatment) indicates that ultrasound is rather inefficient in overall degradation, when used alone.	nld	Elsevier Scientific Publ.

Research work on the influence of vibration on the secondary microstructure of welds and hence on the Charpy toughness was performed. Vibration during welding exhibits positive effects on the microstructure constituent formation. Multipass welding was simulated with reheating of the original single pass weld in order to obtain similar microstructure to multipass welds. Microstructures were examined with an optical microscope. Additionally, fractographic examination of the rupture of Charpy specimens was performed. Changes in the microstructure according to vibration were observed which affect toughness of the weld metal. Vibration during welding was rated more effective in the case of reheating the weld metal, which is the case in multipass welding.	nld	Institute of Materials	2006	1.01	Science and technology of welding and joining	0.891	0.68
10569494	Optimisation of n-octyl oleate enzymatic synthesis over Rhizomucor miehei lipase	Octyl oleate is a useful organic compound with several applications in cosmetic, lubricant and pharmaceutical industry. At first, the enzymatic synthesis of n-octyl oleate by direct lipase-catalysed esterification of oleicacid and 1-octanol was investigated in a stirred batch reactor in solvent-free system. A systematic screening and optimisation of the reaction parameters were performed to gain insight into the kinetics mechanism. Particularly, enzyme concentration, reaction temperature, stirrer speed, watercontent, substrates concentration and molar ratio were optimised with respect to the final product concentration and reaction rate. The kinetics mechanism of the reaction was investigated. Finally, a comparison of the experimental results obtained in a solvent free-system with those using two different solvents, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and n-hexane, was proposed. It resulted that in SC-CO2 higher concentration of the desired product was attained, requiring lower enzyme concentrations to achieve comparable conversion of free fatty acid into fatty acid ester.	nld	Springer	2006	1.01	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering	1.092	0.921
10573083	Tribochemistry in sliding wear of TiCN-Ni-based cermets	The tailoring of cermet composition to improve tribological properties requires careful choice of the type of secondary carbide. To investigate this aspect, a number of sliding tests were carried out on baseline TiCN-20Ni cermet and TiCN-20wt%Ni-10 wt% XC cermets (X = W/Nb/Ta/Hf) at varying loads of5N, 20N, and 50N against bearing steel. With these experiments, we attemptedto answer some of the pertinent issues: (i) how does the type of secondary carbide (WC/NbC/TaC/HfC) influence friction and wear behavior, and is such influence dependent on load?; and (ii) how does the secondary carbide addition affect the stability and composition of the tribochemical layer under the selected sliding conditions? Our experimental results reveal that theadded secondary carbides influence chemical interactions between different oxides and such interactions dominate the friction and wear behavior. A higher coefficient of friction (COF) range, varying from 0.75 to 0.64 was recorded at 5N; whereas the reduced COF of 0.46-0.52 was observed at 20N or 50N. The volumetric wear rate decreased with load and varied on the order of 10-6 to 10-7 mm3/Nm for the cermets investigated. The cermet containing HfC exhibited high friction and poor wear resistance. At low load (5N), the abrasion and adhesion of hard debris containing various oxides dominated the wear, and resulted in high friction and wear loss. In contrast, the more pronounced increase in friction-induced contact temperature (below 500 °C) andcompaction of hard debris resulted in the formation of a distinct tribochemical layer at higher loads (20N and 50N). The formation of a dense tribolayer containing oxides of iron and/or titanium is responsible for the reduced friction and wear, irrespective of secondary carbides.	usa	Published for the Materials Research Society by the American Institute of Physics	2008	1.01	Journal of materials research	1.743	1.953

10587419	Analytical solutions in elasto-plasto bending of beams with rectangular cross section	Deflection analysis of beams with rectangular cross section is considered under specific loading conditions, resulting in at most quadratic bending moment distribution, and assuming elasto-plastic behaviour with no hardening. Within the framework of small strain and small displacement approach analytical solutions are derived, which enable elasto-plastic analyses of beams to be performed in a closed analytical form. In consequence, clear tracing of the elasto-plastic response evolution with a propagation of the plastic zone through the volume, i.e. its spreading along the beam's longitudinal axis as well as its penetration through the cross section, is enabled as loads increase, from the appearance of a first plastic yielding in a structure till its collapse. With the derivation of the general solution, listed explicitly by Eqs. (21), (22) and (23), which was never presented in any article or book before, the presented article fills the gap in the analytical non-linear mechanics of beams.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Ltd	2009	1.01	Applied mathematical modelling	1.375	0.918

10587931	Prediction of the dynamic properties of temperature sensors in arbitrary gases	This paper presents a theoretical investigation with experimental model verification of the dynamic properties identification of contact temperature sensors in arbitrary gases. For prediction of dynamic behaviour of temperaturesensors in mainly uncommon atmospheres and under conditions where standard experimental work could not be carried out, a mathematical model was built for calculating the dynamic parameters of temperature sensors in various gases at different thermodynamic conditions on the basis of experimental work. Frequently, a sensor's dynamic properties and sensitivity to different or changed thermodynamic conditions such as temperature, pressure, velocity, or even composition of gases in operation conditions can be a crucial factor in the regulation and control of the system. The main part of the contribution describes the mathematical model, its connection with the experimental results and limits within which the discussed relation are valid. The contribution also introduces, on the based of non-dimensional correlation and supposition that the time behaviour, is a function of pressureand velocity; a simplified expression is offered for the calculation the heat transfer coefficient as one of the most significant factor in determining the dynamic properties and behaviour of temperature sensor. The presented investigation has shown applicability of an elaborated mathematical model in connection with experimental results, as well as the employability ofa simplified calculated expression which was verified with a standard iterative method. The built model and results of calculations show high applicability of the model, especially in investigations and analyses where different arbitrary gases under different thermodynamic conditions are used.	usa	Marcel Dekker, Inc.	2008	1.01	Instrumentation science & technology	0.435	1.318
10588187	Parameters affecting water-hammer wave attenuation, shape and timing Part 1	This two-part paper investigates key parameters that may affect the pressure waveform predicted by the classical theory of water-hammer. Shortcomings in the prediction of pressure wave attenuation, shape and timing originate from violation of assumptions made in the derivation of the classical waterhammer equations. Possible mechanisms that may significantly affect pressure waveforms include unsteady friction, cavitation (including column separation and trapped air pockets), a number of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effects, viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe-wall material, leakages and blockages. Engineers should be able to identify and evaluate the influence of these mechanisms, because first these are usually not included instandard water-hammer software packages and second these are often ""hidden"" in practical systems. Part 1 of the two-part paper describes mathematical tools for modelling the aforementioned mechanisms. The method of characteristics transformation of the classical water-hammer equations is used herein as the basic solution tool. In separate additions: a convolution-based unsteady friction model is explicitly incorporated; discrete vapour and gas cavity models allow cavities to form at computational sections; coupled extended water-hammer and steel-hammer equations describe FSI; viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe-wall material is governed by a generalised Kelvin-Voigt model; and blockages and leakages are modelled as endor internal boundary conditions.	esp	International association of hydraulic engineering and research	2008	1.01	Journal of hydraulic research	0.883	0.815

Part 2 of the paper presents a number of case studies showing how these modelled sources affect pressure traces in a simple reservoir-pipeline-valve system.

With the migration of traditional telephone PSTNs to packet-based voice services, it is crucial to be able to provide the same services with this new technology without any degradation in quality of service or inconvenience to the end user. It presents an example of a national operator of traditional telephony, who encountered explicit echo problems in its network when upgrading it with packet-based technology. The reasons for an extensive echo are analysed and the guidelines for solving the problem s are given. In particular, it explains the requirements of VolP gateway echo canceller operation to work in network conditions that are much more demanding than described in the ITU- T G.168 Recommendation and stresses how voice transmission over the packet-based network exposes the existing inconvenient or non-standard conditions of traditional telephone PSTN.	gbr	TCN UK	2006	1.01	The journal	0.082	0.723

Such modelling is becoming increasingly important because of the rapid growth of so-called ""smart sensor"" applications based on micro-mechanical devices. Our task was to create a reliable model of a micro-mechanical acceleration sensor that uses an extremely small and easy-to-produce mechanical system. The suspended mass and the output signal of this sensor are one order of magnitude smaller than existing systems. The described model was used for the further development of the mechanical and electrical parts of the system. The modelling inputs were the measurement data of the prototype devices, comprising the static characteristics of the device and the system responses to step-function excitation. Together with known physical properties and basic theoretical equations these data enabled us to create the described model, which showed good agreement with the measurement results.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.03	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

10604310	Dynamic neural network approach for tool cutting force modelling of end milling operations	This paper uses the artificial neural networks (ANNs) approach to evolve an efficient model for estimation of cutting forces, based on a set of input cutting conditions. Neural network (NN) algorithms are developed for use as a direct modelling method, to predict forces for ball-end milling operations. Prediction of cutting forces in ball-end milling is often needed in order to establish automation or optimization of the machining processes. Supervised NNs are used to successfully estimate the cutting forces developed during end milling processes. The training of the networks is preformed with experimental machining data. The predictive capability of using analytical and NN approaches is compared. NN predictions for three cutting force components were predicted with 4% error by comparing with the experimental measurements. Exhaustive experimentation is conduced to develop the model and to validate it. By means of the developed method, it is possible to forecast the development of events that will take place during the milling process without executing the tests. The force model can be used for simulation purposes and for defining threshold values in cutting tool condition monitoring system. It can be used also in the combination for monitoring and optimizing of the machining process-cutting parameters.	usa	Gordon and Breach Science Publishers.	2006	1.01	International journal of general systems	0.620	1.001

A two-dimensional temperature response of the bottom surface is measured with a calibrated thermographic camera. By solving an axisymmetric boundary value heat conduction problem, the normal spectral emissivity at 1064 nm is determined by using an iterative nonlinear least-squares estimation procedure.

The belt was modeled as a planar beam element based on an absolute nodal coordinate formulation. A viscoelastic material was adopted for the belt and the corresponding damping and stiffness matrices were determined. The belt-pulley contact was formulated as a linear complementarity problem together with a penalty method. This made it possible for us to accurately predict the contact forces, including the stick and slip zones between the belt and the pulley. The belt-drive model was verified by comparing it with the available analytical solutions. A good agreement was found. Finally, the applicability of the method was demonstrated by considering non-steady belt-drive operating conditions.	gbr	Academic Press	2009	1.01	Journal of Sound and Vibration	1.414	0.969

The displacements are first expressed through wave potentials and the Hankel integral transform in the radial coordinate is applied to the governing equations and boundary conditions, leading to the solutions in the transformed domain. After the application of the inverse Hankel transform it is shown that the inversion integrands are symmetric/antimetric in the transformation parameter and that this characteristic is preserved for any number of layers. Based on this fact the infinite inversion integrals are reduced to integrals with finite range by choosing the suitable representation of the Bessel function and use of the fundamental rules of contour integration, permitting simpler analytical or numerical evaluation. A numerical example is presented and the results are compared to those obtained by the CLASSI program.	deu	Springer Verlag	2006	1.01	Archive of applied mechanics	0.590	1.092

Extraction was performed with supercritical carbon dioxide on a semi-continuous flow apparatus at pressures of 200 and 300 bar, and at temperatures of 40 and 60 °C. A constant flow rate of carbon dioxide in the range from 0.17 to 0.20 kghwas maintained during extraction. The extraction yields obtained using dense CO2 were similar to those obtained with conventional extraction using hexane as solvent. The composition of extracted crude oil was determined by GCanalysis. The best results were obtained at 300 bar and 40 °C for both seed types extracted, where the quality of oil was highest with regard to GLA content.

1062761	The Use virtual reality-based dynamometer training to enhance selective joint torque control in a child with cerebral palsy	Virtual reality (VR) environments present nowadays a powerful tool for visual feedback in assessment and training programs of rehabilitation. Designing appropriate target-oriented tasks may enhance the rehabilitation options available in biomechanical dynamometry. The subjects are motivated to achieve a goal in the VR environment, and therefore, their performance often increases. This adds a significant value to the evaluation of the subjectæs capabilities and design of the appropriate training program that may enhance the selective joint torque control in children with cerebral palsy. In this paper, we suggest a VR environment that offers motivation for maximal joint torque generation and VE for joint torque control training. A dynamometer withtorque sensor and axis motor was used in the process and enabled biomechanical information, i.e. knee joint torque and surface electromyography, assessment during the target-oriented VR based task. A 12-year old child with cerebral palsy participated in the case study. The protocol consisted of three consecutive days of virtual reality-supported training under various conditions, like task velocity and difficulty level. Our data suggested that there were improvements in the knee joint torque tracking and increased target hit score regardless of the task difficulty level. Besides the improvement of the knee joint torque control, presumably more muscle power could be generated, resulting in more successful performanceat targets where high joint torque was required. Apparently high level of motivation has been noticed. The advantages of using VE for rehabilitation services were shown in variability of attractive target oriented tasks, repeatability and highly motivated subjects. Hereby, a VR environment guided dynamometer based assessment and training for single joint was demonstrated. The promising outcomes call for longer training period and clinical evaluation of modern therapeutic approach.	twn	Biomedical Engineering Society of ROC.	2010	1.01	Journal of medical and biological engineering	0.420	1.925

HSS-BRM2 material that was vacuum quenched and tempered was machined. After the machining with that kind of tool property, the surface layer of the workpiece can be completely damage-free. Practical implications assume that a hard turning is a semi finishing or finishing process relevance. Surface roughness is a consequence of both cutting instability and of tool/workpiece loading condition. Originality of this paper is in an analysis of sources and prevention of workpiece material structure damage while reaching high machined surface quality and workpiece geometrical tolerances.	che	Inderscience Enterprises	2008	1.01	International journal of materials & product technology	0.157	1.953
10629660	How qualitative elements of relational exchanges influence an implementation of purchasing marketing strategies - a case of service companies in Slovenia	The author examines a relationship between the qualitative elements of relational exchanges and the implementation of relationship marketing strategies vs. transactional marketing strategies from the buyer's perspective in business-to-business exchanges. Therefore, four groups of qualitative relational exchange' factors have been determined: attractiveness of supplier, attractiveness of total purchasing market for the buyer, competitive position of the buyer on the purchasing market, and the bargaining orientation of the buyer toward its strategic supplier. Drawing on emerging perspectives on service companies with more than 200 employees in Slovenia and their relationship with strategic suppliers, the author proposes that a buyer's perception of qualitative elements of relational exchanges influences employment of particular marketing strategies towards its strategic supplier. Results of empirical study show some correlation between the groups of variables investigated. The influence of measured factors on the implementation of particular group of marketing strategies exists, although the strongest impact is prevailed especially by factors, which are characteristic for short-term relationships. Hence the surveyed companies are oriented much more toward achieving short-term efficiency instead of long-term effectiveness. This research makes a contribution to the strategy literature and to the practitioners, and has important implications for purchasing managers by offering guidelines for mixing the various aspects of partnering according to their objectives and strategies in order to improve the level of their relational approach to their strategic suppliers.	hrv	Fakultet ekonomije i turizma ""Dr. Mijo Mirkoviæ""	2011	1.01	Ekonomska istraivanja	0.193	1.032
10630684	The integration and requisite holism of the enterprises' governance and management as preconditions for coping with global environmental changes	The main goal of our research was to determine the modes of governance and management in examined enterprises and to see how well enterprises are prepared to cope with difficult economic conditions caused by the crisis which started in 2008. The presence of advanced modes of management (evolutionarily described as cognitive and integral or integrative management) is the necessary precondition to deal with difficult economic times. The research results show that the more advanced cognitive and integrative modes of management are present to a greater extent in larger enterprises; they are present in smaller enterprises as well, but only to a lesser extent. The research was carried out in Slovenia, a former socialist country and EU member. The findings of our study may also have implications for other countries with a similar make-up.	hun	Bp.

Therefore, our main research problem focused on the differences in informal and formal institutional measures of business ethics implementation. We used the case study research methodology to explore the differences of informal and formal institutional measures of business ethics implementation at different stages of the enterprise life cycle.

1063271	Micro vs. macro reinforcement of brickwork masonry	In this paper the effect of different modifications of mortar on the behaviour of brick masonry has been experimentally studied. Two modifications of ordinary cement lime rich mortar were made by introducing polypropylene fibres (micro reinforcement) and by reinforcing mortar bed joints by ,eans of non-metallic meshes (macro reinforcement). Experimental tests were carried on the constituents of the masonry, as well as on masonry specimens consisting of wallettes and panels. Following different methodologies of testing masonry by means of compressive, diagonal and shear tests, the results of the investigation revealed that by reinforcing masonry material both compressive and tensile (shear) strength could be improved. Also from the results of the different test methods, it has been concluded that diagonal tests are not suitable for investigations of reinforced masonry.	fra	E. & F. N.

10632732	Cross Border Economic Convergence and EU Integration Process	The real benefits of integrating different economic areas and regions into one common economic, monetary, and sometimes also fiscal area are among the most important issues to be resolved because the win-win situation for all participants should prevail unless the Member States or local authorities lose their interest in further participation. In this study, we compare the speed and the real benefits of economic integration between the three groups of Member States that emerged following the last big EU enlargement. The first group is composed of the so-called old EU Member States. The second group represents the countries that achieved full membership in 2004 (the so-called new Member States), and in the third group, there are the countries that are now in the negotiation process for EU membership. We then draw from the experience of these new Member States to derive implications for a possible new round of EU enlargement. The conclusion of this paper is therefore supposed to be some kind of direction for the new candidate countries. The results offer an answer to the question of what degree of convergence the new EU10 Member States reached within certain macroeconomic fundamentals during the period of their accession negotiations.	svn	Intitut za lokalno samoupravo in javna naroèila	2011	1.01	Lex localis	0.317	0.759
1063529	Psychometric properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale in polio survivors	The objective of this study was to evaluate by means of classical test theory and Rasch analysis the scaling characteristics and psychometric properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in polio survivors. A questionnaire, consisting of five general questions (sex, age, age at time of acute polio, sequelae of polio, and new symptoms), the FSS, and three questions from the Visual Analog Scale questions on fatigue was sent to all 196 polio survivors at the Institute for Rehabilitation in Ljubljana. Responses were assessed in terms of Cronbach's ?, item-to-total correlation, factor analysis, and Rasch analysis. Of the 128 (65.3%) valid questionnaires returned, those presenting no missing values were used for subsequent analyses (n=117). The FSS showed good internal consistency: Cronbach's ? was greater than 0.95, item-to-total correlation ranged from 0.68 to 0.88. A reduction from seven to three rating categories was necessary to comply with criteria for correct category function. Item difficulty estimates spanned from -0.91 to +1.09 logits. No item bias was found for sex and age. The internal consistency of FSS was high and its item separation reliability good, indicating a satisfactory replicability of item placement in other samples. In conclusion, Rasch analysis enabled us to confirm the validity of FSS (in its 8-item version, without item 1) as a measure of the severity and impact of physical symptoms of fatigue in polio survivors, so providing a useful starting point for further studies aimed at examining additional psychometric aspects and confirming the appropriateness of the simplification of its rating categories.	gbr	Lipincott Williams & Wilkins	2010	1.01	International journal of rehabilitation research	1.192	1.126
10636827	Differences in the tribological mechanisms when using non-doped, metal-doped (Ti, WC), and non-metal-doped (Si) diamond-like carbon against steel under boundary lubrication, with and without oil additives	In this paper, we report on the tribological performance and mechanisms of the boundary-lubricated contacts of steel against diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings, i.e., steel/DLC, using the same materials, oils, additives and conditions as we have previously reported for DLC/DLC contacts. We present and compare the behaviour of two non-doped, two metal-doped (Ti, WC) and one non-metal-doped (Si) DLC coatings in contact with steel surfaces in reciprocating sliding, lubricated with a paraffinic mineral base oil with and without anti-wear and extreme-pressure additives. Friction behaviour similar to that of the steel/steel surfaces is observed in all the steel/coating contacts, irrespective of the coating type. However, the doped and non-doped coatings showed different wear behaviours. The non-doped DLC coatings provided the lowest wear with the base oils, due to the absence of adhesion between the steel and the DLC coating. In contrast, additivation of the oil was necessary for the adhesion prevention and successful operation of the steel/doped-DLC contacts.	che	Elsevier Sequoia	2006	1.01	Thin Solid Films	1.666	1.024

For this purpose, a taper manufacturing technique that allows the production of long and highly uniform tapers was developed.

10643478	Fracture behaviours of fracture toughness testing specimens with metallurgical heterogeneity along crack front	Safe use of welded structures is dependent on fracture mechanics properties of welded joints. In present research, high strength low alloyed HSLA steel in a quenched and tempered condition, corresponding to the grade HT 80, was used. The fluxo cored arc welding process (FCAW), with CO2 as shielding gas, was used and two different tubular wires were selected. The aim of this paper is to analyse fracture behaviour of undermatched welded joints, and also to determine relevant parameters which contribute to higher critical values of fracture toughness. Towards this end three differently undermatched welded joints were analysed using results of testing the composite notched specimens with through thickness crack front positioned partly in the weld metal, partly in heat affected zone (HAZ) and partly in base material (BM). The presence of different microstructures along the pre-crack fatigue front has an important effect on the critical crack tip opening displacement (CTOD). This value is the relevant parameter for safe service of welded structure. In the case of specimens with through thickness notch partly in the weld metal, partly in the heat affected zone and partly in the base material, i.e. using the composite notched specimen, fracture behaviour strongly depends on a partition of ductile base material, size and distribution of mismatching factor along vicinity of crack front. If local brittle zones occur in the process zone, ductile base metal can not prevent pop-in instability, but it can reduce it to an insignificant level while the fracture toughness parameter is higher and the weakest link concept can not be applied.	deu	Verlag Stahleisen	2000	1.01	Steel research	0.320	0.465

For a specimen with a through-thickness notch partly in the weld metal, partly in the heat-affected zone, and partly in the base material (i.e., using the com- posite-notched specimen), fracture behavior strongly depends on the propor- tion of ductile base material, size, and distribution of the mismatching factor along the vicinity of the crack front.	usa	Marcel Dekker	2001	1.01	Materials and manufacturing processes	0.288	0.351

This framework can be used to approach a number of questions such as species-erea distribution, species-range size distribution, the rate of ecological turnover, asymmetries of range division between sister species, waiting time until speciation and extinction, the relationship between the geographic range size and the probability of speciation, the relationship between the geographic range size and the probability of speciation, the relationship between subpopulation-level parameters and metapopulation-level parameters, and the effects of taxonomic level on these rates, distributions, and parameters. We illustrate some of these applications using numerical simulations. We develope approximations describing the dependence of the number of different taxonomic units, their average range size, and the rate of their turnover on the system size, the rate of fixation of genetic (or morphological) changes in local demes, and the rate of local extinction and colonization.	usa	Society for the Study of Evolution.	2000	1.01	Evolution	3.632	1.482
10648342	On the application of a simple computational model for slender transversely cracked beams in buckling problems	This paper discusses the implementation of a simplified computational model that is widely used for the computation of transverse displacements in transversely cracked slender beams into the Euler's elastic flexural buckling theory. Two alternatives are studied instead of solving the corresponding differential equations to obtain exact analytical expressions for the buckling load ?$P_{cr}$? due to the complexity of this approach. The first approach implements wisely selected polynomials to describe the behavior of the structure, which allows the derivation of approximate expressions for the critical buckling load. Although the relevance of the results strongly depends on the proper prime selection of the polynomial, it is shown that the later upgrading of the polynomials can lead to even more reliable results. The second approach is a purely numerical approach and presents the geometrical stiffness matrix for a beam finite element with a transverse crack. To support the discussed approaches, numerical examples covering several structures with different boundary conditions are briefly presented. The results obtained with the presented approaches are further compared with the values from enormous 2D finite elements models, where a detailed description of the crack was achieved with the discrete approach. It is evident that the drastic difference in the computational effort is not reflected in the significant differences in the results between the models.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Computational materials science	1.135	1.682

10648598	New finite element for transversely cracked slender beams subjected to transverse loads	The paper covers the derivation of a new finite element for beams with transverse cracks. The derivation is based on a simplified computational model that has already proved itself suitable for the inverse identification of cracks. The model embodies all the necessary major information about the structure's response from the inverse identification point of view, where the presence and location and, if possible, the depth of the crack should be detected from the measured response, usually dynamic. In such situations the stress distributions obtained from 2D finite elements analysis are not as important as the computational model being capable of reliably describing the displacement of the structure. However, from numerical studies it also became evident that the relevance of the model decreases with element thickness. This indicated that shear forces should be included in the analysis process. Therefore, derivation of a new finite element with the inclusion of shear forces effect has been executed. The stiffness matrix for transversely cracked slender beams, as well as the derivation of interpolation functions is presented and all expressions are given in symbolic forms. The example shows that, although with significantly less computational effort than with 2D FE meshes, significant improvement in transverse displacements can be obtained with the presented beam finite element.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Computational materials science	1.135	1.682
10648921	On Herstein's Lie map conjectures, II	The theory of functional identities is used to study derivations of Lie algebras arising from associative algebras. Definitive results are obtained modulo algebras of ""low dimension"". In particular, Lie derivations of ?${\cal [K,K]/([K,K] \cap Z)}$?, where ?${\cal K}$? is the Lie algebra of skew elements of a prime algebra with involution and ?${\cal Z}$? is its center, are described. This solves the last remaining open problem of Herstein on Lie derivations. For a simple algebra with involution the Lie algebra of all derivations of ?${\cal [K,K]/([K,K] \cap Z)}$? is thoroughly analyzed. Maps that act as derivations on arbitrary fixed polynomials are also discussed, and in particular a solution is given for Herstein's question concerning maps of ?${\cal K}$? which act like a derivation on ?$x^m$?, ?$m$? being a fixed odd integer.	usa	Academic Press	2001	1.01	Journal of algebra	0.501	0.48

An innovative immersion testing apparatus is developed, at which Aluminium Alloy die casting is simulated. It enables controlled thermal fatigue cycling.Special specimens with different edge geometry and specimens with maraging steel welds deposited by Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA) welding are prepared.They are subjected to cyclic heating in bath of molten Aluminium Alloy 226 and cooling in bath of water-based lubricant. The specimens are continuously internally cooled with cold water. The microstructure, hardness profile, and the surface cracks developed are periodically analyzed after completion of a particular number of cycles. Temperature transients at different locations of the specimens are measured and used in calibration of finite element model (FEM). The computation of transient stresses is performedby developed FEM. The influence of immersion test parameters, material, specimen edge geometry, and thickness of maraging steel surfacing welds on thermal stresses is studied. To improve thermal fatigue testing efficiency, a specimen of particular geometry and immersion test parameters are developed based on finite element analysis. The results showed significant differences in produced thermal stresses for analyzed materials, test parameters, and edge geometries. Maraging steel is found to be superior material for die casting dies, due to generation of lower stresses.	nld	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Computational materials science	1.549	1.953
10656028	Are we getting closer to purchasing power parity in Central and Eastern European economies?	In this article we examine the theory of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) on a sample of Central and Eastern European economies. The article makes two main advances with respect to previous PPP studies. First, it employs a monthly database on real exchange rates for a panel of 12 Central and Eastern European economies by testing the theory separately with respect to the US dollar and to the euro for the period January 1994 to December 2008. Second, we utilize, among other panel unit root tests, the panel Seemingly Unrelated Regressions Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SURADF) test proposed by Breuer et al. (2002), which allows us to identify how many and which members of the panel contain a unit root. As our study found support for the validity of PPP in some reforming European economies, special attention should be devoted to individual country-specific factors that cause PPP deviations.	gbr	Chapman & Hall	2012	1.01	Applied economics letters	0.226	1.032
10658843	Suitability of maraging steel weld cladding for repair of die casting tooling Part II	This study was done to evaluate precipitation annealing of 18% Ni maraging steel repair welds during aluminium alloy die casting and to predict the prolonged in-service tool life. The emphasis of this study was the influence of post-weld precipitation annealing heat treatment and aluminium die casting thermal cycling on metallurgical and mechanical properties. A series of specimens of 1.2344 tool steel was prepared to which 1.6356 maraging steel wasgas tungsten arc weld clad. Analysis of weld microstructure and hardness was made in order to understand the metallurgical processes during heat treatment at elevated temperatures and at prolonged time. The Response Surfacemodel for prediction of hardness after heat treatment was developed. The edges of immersion test specimens are gas tungsten arc weld clad with 1.6356 maraging steel and machined to the final edge geometry. Two specimens were tested in as-welded condition and two in optimally aged condition. Testing was performed on specially developed immersion test apparatus, which enables the simulation of thermal fatigue during aluminium alloy die casting. After completion of a particular number of thermal fatigue cycles the weld microstructure and hardness were evaluated. A hypothetical model for prediction of precipitation annealing time during aluminium alloy die casting was proposed. The results showed that tool heating lasts 30% of molten metal injection time, preparing conditions for precipitation annealing at 10% of injection time, and precipitation annealing at 60% of injection time. These results, together with a finite element model for prediction of tool temperature and response surface model for prediction of hardness after precipitation annealing, enable accurate prediction of maraging steel tool hardness after any particular number of die casting cycles and consequently in-service tool life. The thermal fatigue resistance of maraging steel welds was compared to AISI H13 tool steel. The results showed superior thermal fatique resistance for AISI H13.	deu	Hanser	2008	1.01	International journal of materials research	0.819	0.738

1066121	Comparative analysis of inactivated wood surfaces	The surface inactivation of two wood species, yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and southern pine (Pinus taeda), was studied following high temperature drying. Surface analysis involved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, sessile drop wettability and fracture mechanics of the adhesively-jointed surfaces. The results showed that wood drying at high temperature (i.e., > 160 to 180 °C) caused modifications in surface composition. The oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) decreased and the ratio of carbon atoms bonded to other carbon or to hydrogen atoms vis-a-vis carbons bonded to oxygen atoms (i.e., the C1/ C2 ratio) increased with drying temperature. In addition, the contact angle increased with the temperature of exposure, but decreased with time. A dependence on wood species was evident: southern pine surfaces always exhibited higher contact angles than yellow poplar. Also, the rate of contact angle decline with time, dq/dt, was found tovary with surface composition: this rate corresponded to O/C ratio-changes, especially in the case of southern pine. Southern pine was most susceptible toinactivation particularly when bonded with PF adhesive. Yellow poplar surfaces did not show significant inactivation when exposed to drying temperatures below ca. 180 °C. The results are explained by a relative enrichment of wood surfaces with non-polar substances, hydrophobic extractives and volatile organic compounds that become visually evident during the drying process at temperatures above ca. 160 °C. Little change was observed if drying temperatures remained below 150 °C.	usa	Technischer Verlag Herbert Cram	2004	1.01	Holzforschung	0.939	0.492

The sorption properties of differently pre-treated flax fibers were defined by iodine sorption value, moisture sorption, and water retention power. The residual pre-treatment baths were ecologically analyzed using total organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand and biological degradability. The obtained results indicated that the alkaline, acidic and enzymatic scourings of flax fibers have a significant effect on their sorption properties and, consequently, on the bleaching process. The application of ultrasound in the scouring and bleaching bath increased the fiber weight loss and water retention power of the flax fibers, as well as improving the ecological parameters. The optimal pre-treatment process was enzymatic bioscouring because it provided a lower weight loss, a better absorptivity of the flax fibers, and is less environmentally harmful.	usa	Sage Publications	2006	1.01	Textile research journal	0.578	0.597
10666262	An impedance study of two types of stainless steel in Ringer physiological solution containing complexing agents	The effect of complexing agents EDTA and citric acid on the electrochemical behaviour of AISI 304 and orthopaedic stainless steels in Ringer physiological solution was investigated by potentiodynamic polarization method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The content of Mo has a pronounced effect on the corrosion resistance, as evident by the broader passive range of the orthopaedic stainless steel containing Mo. The addition of complexing agents induces significant changes in polarization and impedance characteristics, i.e., the shift of corrosion and breakdown potentials in a more negative direction, an increase in current density, and a significant decrease in charge transfer resistance. The results were interpreted by the formation of soluble complexes of metal ions with chelating agents, especially EDTA, which suppressed the formation of the outer Fe(III) layer of the passive film. The impact of complexing agent on the electrochemical parameters was found to be related to its concentration in electrolyte and the stability constant of the complex formed with the related metal ion.	gbr	Chapman and Hall	2006	1.01	Journal of materials science.

10666518	Substitution of the constant phase element by Warburg impedance for protective coatings	This paper proposes an alternative model for fitting electrochemical impedance spectra of protective coatings. It describes broadening of the semicircle in the complex plane, in the absence of corrosion reactions. In addition the infinite Warburg impedance circuit element is represented, which bridges existing parallel elements of the plate capacitor and resistor of a classical equivalent electrical circuit. The Warburg impedance element is the result of the Fick's second law on partial differential equation solution. The proposed model and, for comparison the model with the CPE element, are used on our epoxy protective system to describe EIS measurements. The proposed model shows a better quality of fitting for our EIS data in comparison to the model with CPE.	gbr	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	Corrosion science	1.895	0.661

The fuels under consideration are neat biodiesel from rapeseed oil and some blends with diesel as well as neat mineral diesel D2. The fuel and fuel temperature influences are investigated experimentally in the mechanically controlled diesel fuel injection M system. At first, attention is focused on the injection characteristics, especially on fuelling, mean injection rate, mean injection pressure, injection timing, injection delay, and injection duration, which influence the most important engine characteristics. Furthermore, the influence of fuel temperature is investigated. On the basis of the measurements of pressure drop through the fuel filter, the minimum fuel temperature for safe engine operation is determined.	usa	The Society	2006	1.01	Energy & fuels	1.519	0.921
10670614	Application of material forces to fracture of inhomogeneous materials	The material forces concept has become an elegant tool in continuum mechanics for the calculation of the thermodynamic driving force of a defect. Based on this concept, we have recently shown that inhomogeneities essentially shield or anti-shield crack tips from applied far-field stresses. The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by considering the model example of a crack in a CT-type specimen that contains a bimaterial interface. The crack driving force is calculated as the sum of the far-field driving force and the crack-tip shielding or anti-shielding. Several cases of inhomogeneity in either thermal or elastic properties are considered. Rather simple hand calculations are provided in addition to numerical results to illustrate the advantages of using the material forces concept.	deu	Springer Verlag	2007	1.01	Archive of applied mechanics	0.523	1.049
10672923	The effects of changes in the climate on the energy demands of buildings	It is generally accepted that climate changes will have a major effect on our lives. However, buildings will also be faced with climate changes, and these changes will have an impact on indoor comfort, energy demands and the efficiency of building services, especially on those supporting free cooling and free heating. In order to predict the expected changes in a building's thermal response during its lifetime, it is necessary to look at the climate changes predicted for the future. In our study, the climate changes were considered by using simplified mathematical models combined with available test reference years to establish corrected test reference years. A transient simulation tool, TRNSYS, was used to simulate the indoor climate and the useful energy demand for the heating and cooling of different buildings with different free-cooling techniques. In order to predict the expected changes in a building's thermal response, the meteorological parameters for the moderate, continental climate region of Slovenia were taken into account. The study shows that during a building's lifetime, significant changes in useful energy demands can be expected - a decrease in the useful energy demand for heating of between 23 and 40% and an up-to-38-times increase in the useful energy needed for mechanical cooling. In buildings without mechanical cooling,the efficiency of the different free-cooling techniques should be increased by between 100 and 200% to ensure the same living comfort. The results presented in the study confirm that it is necessary to evaluate the consequences of global climate changes from the point of view of energy use in buildings, their construction and the building's service installations.	gbr	Wiley-Interscience.	2008	1.01	International journal of energy research	1.016	0.803
10675996	Diagonal cumulation of origin as an institutional incentive mechanism for cost optimisation in contemporary international business	In the emerging process of market globalisation, firms' strategic options for optimising their cross-border operations have broadened. This paper presents a strategic framework for developing an appropriate strategic response of firms by relocating their production facilities and framing their operational procedures in such a way that they may, as eligible beneficiaries, exploit institutional incentive mechanisms available in a specific region or a host country. More specifically, in the paper we explore a strategic option for lowering firms' operational costs through international operations by using the mechanism of diagonal cumulation of origin introduced by the European Union (EU) in its Common Commercial Policy towards selected non-member countries. Despite extensive discussions in theoretical literature on the conception of the rules of origin, only a few studies have explored the implications of this mechanism from the perspective of a firm's transaction costs in international business. This paper shows that the 'SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin,' when properly conceived and implemented by a firm, can positively affect its financial performance. By analysing the cost-effect simulation of a selected household appliance producer in the presented case study, we then discuss the key strategic and operational implications for firms wishing to take advantage of offered supranational institutional incentive mechanisms.	hun	Akadémiai Kiadó	2011	1.01	Acta oeconomica	0.375	1.032
10676252	A market perspective of aligning university business education in transition countries with the emerging globalisation of higher education	The purpose of this article is to explore the implications of higher education globalisation and institutional changes in Europe in terms of their influences on the position of public business education in their local setting in Central and Eastern Europe. We analyse key institutional developments that frame the emerging European Higher Education Area and synthesize their influences on higher education in transition countries. With increased importance of knowledge for competitiveness of European businesses the traditional 'public good' paradigm is being replaced by a 'marketable goods' view. As university business schools in transition countries are particularly exposed to competition in the business education market and serve as key business knowledge providers to future generations of managers, we present a consistent model for the requisitely holistic and strategic management of business education institutions that enables managers to better align their institution with the challenges of an increasingly competitive market in business education.	ltu	Kaunas Faculty of Humanities, Vilnius University	2011	1.01	Transformations in business & economics	0.991	1.032
10685718	Proteinase-catalyzed hydrolysis of casein at atmospheric pressure and in supercritical media	In the presented work, reaction parameters for hydrolysis of casein, catalyzed by Carica papaya latex at atmospheric and high pressure, were optimized. Casein is a remarkably efficient nutrient, supplying not only essential amino acids, but also some carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus and therefore is very important for the food industry. Different reaction parameters such as temperature, stirring rate, casein and enzyme concentration were studied to found the optimal conditions for the reaction. Reactions were performed at atmospheric pressure; an influence of temperature/pressure on the casein hydrolysis in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) was also investigated to improve the reaction rates. Higher conversions were achieved when the reactions were performed in SC CO2, even though casein was not soluble in this medium.	hrv	Croatian Society of Chemical Engineers	2006	1.01	Chemical and biochemical engineering quarterly	0.357	0.921
10685979	Improving repair management of bucket wheel excavator SRs1200 by application of project management concept	The losses resulting from the defect or breakdown of equipment amount to incredible sums, often far higher than the cost of maintenance, repair or reconstruction. It is for this reason that a large number of methods for maintenance and repair of industrial and other plants have been developed. Elaborated in much detail, these methods nevertheless leave a lot of space for improvement. The improvement is primarily viewed in the context of the management of time, resources and costs of such enterprises. This paper presents a certain concept of project management the implementation of which may improve the maintenance and repair projects. The concept was tested in practice and confirmed in the project of revitalizing of the bucket wheel excavator SRs1200 at MB Kolubara, one of the most complex projects of the kind in the region recently, in terms of technical complexity of reconstruction, the number of participants, the number of activities, cost and time of realization, as well as other elements of the project. The application of this concept allowed for achieving significant results in the technical and financial fields, which will further be analyzed in detail.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.04	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986
10686742	The aerobic biodegradation kinetics of plant tannins in industrial wastewater	This paper describes an experimental determination of the biodegradation rate for tannins present in industrial wastewater, after the extraction of chestnut chips. Experiments were performed in a laboratory aerobic reactor (Armfield) by using biomass from an existing industrial wastewater treatment plant. The outlet tannins concentration was determined under various processing conditions. Simultaneously, an optical microscope was used to monitor the mix of microbiological cultures in the biomass. On the basis of data obtained in experiments, non-linear regression was used to perform parametric analysis of various kinetic models, which took into account inhibition, as quoted in literature (Haldane, Edwards, Aiba, Luong). The statistical analysis, based on the P-criterion, F-criterion, adjusted coefficient of determination, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and root mean squared error, showed that the biodegradation of plant tannins in industrial wastewater under selected conditions for aerobic digestion, can be most successfully described statistically by the Aiba's kinetic model.	hrv	Croatian Society of Chemical Engineers	2006	1.01	Chemical and biochemical engineering quarterly	0.357	0.921

Double-door box traps, with a roof that bears easily break (bear permeable traps), have been used to capture individuals. The distances between traps were between 550 to 2200 m. They wereset out on logging roads and narrow trails in the forest. Nine wildcats, one lynx Lynx lynx (Linnaeus, 1758) and one feral cat were caught as target species and 19 badgers Meles meles and one bear cub Ursus arctos as non-targets. The catching success was 1 wildcat58 trap-days and seems to be in correlation with the lunar cycle. Overall, 7 males and 2 female wildcats were captured which might indicate sex biased trapping selection. Methodological improvements shortened the time of handling procedures. Improved field protocols as well as restraining and immobilisation procedures increased reliability and safety of drug administrations, decreased potential chances for injuries and reduced overall stress of captured animals.	pol	Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences	2002	1.01	Acta Theriologica	0.945	0.917
10694427	Steps towards the development of an experimentally verified simulation of pool nucleate boiling on a silicon wafer with artificial sites	Nucleate boiling is a very effective heat transfer cooling process, used in numerous industrial applications. Despite intensive research over decades, a reliable model of nucleate pool boiling is still not available. This paper presents a numerical and experimental investigation of nucleate boiling from artificial nucleation sites. The numerical investigation described in the first section of the paper is carried out by a hybrid mechanistic numerical code first developed at the University of Ljubljana to simulate the temperature field in a heated stainless steel plate with a large number of nucleation sites during pool boiling of water at atmospheric pressure. It is now being redeveloped to interpret experiments on pool boiling at artificial sites on a silicon plate and as a design tool to investigate different arrangements of sites to achieve high heat fluxes. The code combines full simulation of the temperature field in the solid wall with simplified models or correlations for processes in the liquid-vapour region. The current capabilities and limitations of the code are reviewed and improvements are discussed. Examples are given of the removal of computational constraints on the activation of sites in close proximity and improvements to the bubble growth model. Preliminary simulations are presented to compare the wall conditions to be used in the experiments on silicon at Edinburgh University with the conditions in current experiments on thin metal foils at Ljubljana.	gbr	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Applied Thermal Engineering	1.349	0.986
10694683	Prediction of elastic recovery of a formed steel sheet considering stiffness degradation	The aim of this work is to show first, how the springback of a steel sheet drawn part is affected by the stiffness degradation, as it results from the damage evolved during forming process, and second, to build a respective modeling approach to take this degradation into account. For the considerationof the orthotropic elastic properties degradation we develop an approach, based on the Mori-Tanaka theory, where damage is considered by inclusion of ellipsoidal cavities. The respective void shape evolution is proposed to be identified with the measurements of elastic modulus in two perpendicular directions during the uniaxial tensile test of a flat specimen at different loading stages. The proposed approach is coupled with the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) plastic potential, though it could be substituted by almost any other continuum damage model. At the end the presented approach is experimentally validated by a simple springback test, developed by authors. A very good agreement between by calculation predicted and measured springback amount is observed.	ita	Tamburini Editore SpA	2009	1.01	Meccanica	0.892	1.269
10698585	Application of the adjacency matrix eigenvectors method to geometry determination of toroidal carbon molecules	Torusenes are defined as closed toroidal networks where every vertex or atom is 3-valent, and they can represent pure carbon tori. Here we study the geometries of two classes: hexagonal torusenes containing purely polyhex networks and the second class, 5,6,7-ring torusenes which besides hexagons contain also an equal number of 5- and 7-membered rings. As sophisticated quantum-mechanical methods for geometry determination are time consuming for large carbon cages, and having in mind the huge number of their isomers, one is interested in methods which are simply to apply but which are still able to produce plausible geometries. One of them is offered by the adjacency matrix eigenvectors (AME) method. Its application to fullerenes is based on an appropriately chosen triplet of eigenvectors. A rational choice may be made on the basis of their nodal properties. No rules have been formulated up to now on how to apply the AME method to torusenes. In order to find such a rule a systematic study of nodal properties of torusenes is cruical, and such a study is the subject of this paper. Theoretical and computer experimental considerations presented here suggest that a triplet ?${\bf a_2, a_3, a_{opt}}$? fulfills the task where ?${\bf a_{opt}}$? should be checked for among those eigenvectors which possess no radial nodal plane but have one axial cut. In the present paper these findings have been elaborated for 5,6,7-ring torusenes with upto 270 atoms, and computer experiments have shown that similar findings hold for purely polyhex torusenes with up to 224 carbon atoms as well. In order to understand better this nodal properties, a quantum-mechanical study if free electrons on the surface of a torus was also undertaken.	usa	American Institute of physics	2000	1.01	The Journal of chemical physics	3.301	1.646
10702870	In-situ monitoring of internal oxidation of dillute alloys	This paper presents a non-destructive measurement method that enables identification and characterization of phenomena during internal oxidation of metallic materials as well as monitoring the kinetics of internal oxidation using ""in-situ"" electrical resistance measurements. A special laboratory device, based on the unique measurement cell, for the electrical resistance measurements at high temperatures and the model for electrical resistance transformation into an instantaneous microstructure were developed. To accomplish this, the process of internal oxidation was divided into the sequence of the key partial reactions that were presented in the model as the parallel andor serial connected time variable resistors in the electrical circuit. The validity of the transformation model was experimentally confirmedby internal oxidation of Ag-Sn (2 at.% Sn) alloy at different oxidation temperatures in air atmosphere. The comparison of the results obtained by ""in-situ"" electrical resistance measurements with those obtained by metallographic analysis and Wagneræs theory shows that the novel method presents a more effective tool for monitoring of internal oxidation kinetics. The method identifies also the microstructural defects and their influences onthe kinetics of internal oxidation.	nld	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	Corrosion science	1.895	0.661
10704150	Rheological study of interactions between non-ionic surfactants and polysaccharide thickeners used in textile printing	The influence of four non-ionic surfactants (isododecyl and cetyl polyoxyethylene ethers) on aqueous polysaccharide solutions (sodium alginate, guar gum, and sodium carboxymethyl guar), applicable for textile printing pastes, were studied via rheological measurements. Rheology of polysaccharide-surfactant solutions in aqueous matrices is primarily governed by polymer content, which imparts marked shear-thinning and viscoelastic character to the system. Such properties are modulated in moderate but sensible way by changes in surfactant concentration or type. Above 3% surfactants addition to non-substituted guar gum solutions results in a significant impact leading to phase separation and a particular strongly associated phase is formed due to hydrogen bonds between ethylene oxy units from the surfactant and primary hydroxyl groups in guar. A satisfactory fitting of viscosity data is obtained with both the Cross equation and the Roberts-Barnes-Carew model. The experimental results of mechanical spectra can be described quite satisfactory with both the Friedrich-Braun and the generalized Maxwell models.	gbr	Applied Science Publishers	2007	1.01	Carbohydrate polymers	1.782	1.209

The optimization was performed by the nonlinear programming approach, NLP. Accordingly, a NLP optimization modelf or composite floor trusses was developed. An accurate objective function of the manufacturing material, power and labour costs was proposed to be defined for the optimization. Alongside the costs, the objective function also considers the fabrication times, and the electrical power and material consumption. Composite trusses were optimized according to Eurocode 4 for the conditions of both the ultimate and the serviceability limit states. A numerical example of the optimization of the composite truss system presented at the end of the paper demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach.	kor	Techno-Press	2006	1.01	Steel and composite structures	0.300	0.74

In the healthy subjects the SA content of LDL correlated positively with plasma concentration of autoantibodies to oxLDL. In agreement with the literature thedecreased SA content of LDL was associated with an increased fraction of oxLDLè a decreased fraction of oxLDL was associated with an increased plasma concentration of autoantibodies to oxLDL. In the patients the SA content of LDL and plasma concentrations of oxLDL and autoantibodies to oxLDL were not related. We conclude that the SA content of LDL correlates positively with plasma concentration of autoantibodies to oxLDL in healthy subjects. However, this association may vary depending on the stage of atherogenesis. Although our results suggest dependence of LDL SA content on the clearance of oxidatively modified (desialylated and oxidized) LDL from blood by autoantibodies to oxLDL, the mechanisms regulating the SA content of LDL awaitfurther studies	deu	Walter de Gruyter	2002	1.01	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	1.407	1.652

Short product and process development time in combination with low costs and achievement of required quality can be obtainedonly by integrating project management methods with concurrent engineering elements. Project management of orders combined with concurrent engineering elements allows for considerable reduction of development time, reduction of costs, and provides for a higher quality of order/product [1]. Order planning phase is very important in integrated product/process development. In the traditional product/process development, on average only 3% of total order development time is used for planning, while at the concurrent concept this time increases to about 20% [2].	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

Simulation was performed to investigate the efficiency of a simple analoguous system for active noise control without incorporating electronic filters. The transfer function of the entire analogous system can be used to predict the maximum attenuation level. Tests were made to verify the simulation and to show what noise attenuation level can be achieved in an experimental duct.

The emphasis of this study is the influence ofpost-weld precipitation annealing heat treatment and aluminium die casting thermal cycling on metallurgical and mechanical properties. A series of specimens of 1.2344 tool steel is prepared to which 1.6356 maraging steel is GTA weld cladded. Analysis of weld microstructure and hardness is made in order to understand the metallurgical processes during heat treatment at elevated temperatures and at prolonged time. The Response Surface (RS) model for prediction of hardness after heat treatment is developed. To the edges of immersion test specimens 1.6356 maraging steel is GTA welded. The edges are machined to the final edge geometry. Two specimens are tested in as-welded condition and two in optimally aged condition. Testing is preformed on developed immersion test apparatus, which enables the simulation of thermal fatigue during aluminium die casting. After completion of a particular number of thermal fatigue cycles the weld microstructure and hardness is evaluated. Based on these results a hypothetical model for prediction of precipitation annealing time during aluminium die casting is proposed. The results showed that tool heating takes place at 25% of molten metal injection time, preparing conditions for precipitation annealing at 15% of injection time, and precipitation annealing at 60% of injection time. These results, together witha finite element (FE) model for prediction of tool temperature and RS model for prediction of hardness after precipitation annealing, enable accurate prediction of maraging steel tool hardness after particular number ofdie casting cycles and consequently in-service tool life.	nld	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Computational materials science	1.549	1.953

Let ?$E$? be a Dedekind complete Banach lattice dimension of least two, and let ?${\cal S}$?be a multiplicative semigroup of quasinilpotent positive abstract kernel operators on ?$E$?.

It is easy to see that the genus ?$g(G)$? of the apex graph ?$G$? is bounded above by ?$\tau - 1$?, where ?$\tau$? is the minimum face cover of the neighbors of ?$w$?, taken over all planar embeddings of ?$G-w$?. The main result of this paper is the linear lower bound ?$g(G) \ge \tau/160$? (if ?$G-w$? is 3-connected and ?$\tau > 1$?). It is also proved that the minimum face cover problem is ?${\bf NP}$?-hard for planar triangulations and that the minimum vertex cover is ?${\bf NP}$?-hard for 2-connected cubic planar graphs. Finally, it is shown that computing the genus of apex graphs is ?{\bf NP}?-hard.	usa	Academic Press	2001	1.01	Journal of combinatorial theory	0.514	0.48

10756118	Antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements	Recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. One of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. Most Slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. In addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. On the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. In our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium terrae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. Candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. Swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. It was found that E. faecium, S. aureus, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa survivedat 60 °C, but no microorganisms were found at 75 °C.	usa	Elsevier Science Pub.

10768411	Feed rate optimization in free form machining using NURBS approximation	Constant development of manufacturing technologies for quality improvement of machining results has become a very important fact in modern industry. Therefore, reducing machining time and improving machining operations through adaptation of cutting tool feed rates is a great step in this direction. This paper is focused on improved algorithm for efficient adaptation and calculation of feed rate variable that keeps the instantaneous volumetric removal rate constant during the machining operation. Feed rate values are established for a particular free form surface area, which is supposed to be an optimal area for applying milling-path strategy. Different obtained values of feed rates are then interpolated using NURBS approximation curve fitting approach, and in this way a very smooth transition is guaranteed between neighbouring surfaces. In addition also a new NURBS feed rate interpolator could be incorporated into an open-architecture CNC controller. The proposed approach results in much better surface quality and more stabile dynamic behaviour of machine tool, as well as in a reduction of cutting time, and in this way try to satisfy the constant growing requirements of today's machining needs.	gbr	Pergamon	2008	1.01	Computers & Industrial Engineering	1.057	1.018

The first approach is commonly used Ludwig's law with the extension over large strains based on the pre-necking response of a tensile test specimen, whereas the second approach is inverse identification which is based on the post-necking behaviour of the same tensile test specimen. Features of both approaches are examined in the tensile test and deep drawing simulations. In the tensile test simulation the inverse identification method proved to be superior over Ludwig's law. The deep drawing simulation demonstrates how inappropriate yield curve usage leads to wrong predictions.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

10781211	Development of artificial neural network model for a coal-fired boiler using real plant data	Development of artificial neural network (ANN) models using real plant data for the prediction of fresh steam properties from a brown coal-fired boiler of a Slovenian power plant is reported. Input parameters for this prediction were selected from a large number of available parameters. Initial selection was made on a basis of expert knowledge and previous experience. However, the final set of input parameters was optimized with a compromise between smaller number of parameters and higher level of accuracy through sensitivity analysis. Data for training were selected carefully from the available real plant data. Two models were developed, one including mass flow rate of coal and the other including belt conveyor speed as one of the input parameters. The rest of the input parameters are identical for both models. Both models show good accuracy in prediction of real data not used for their training. Thus both of them are proved suitable for use in real life, either on-line or off-line. Better model out of these two may be decided on a case-to-case basis depending on the objective of their use. The objective of these studies was to examine the feasibility of ANN modeling for coal-based power or combined heat and power (CHP) plants.	gbr	Pergamon Press.	2009	1.01	Energy	2.952	1.335

10786844	The influence of external factors on routine ERP usage	Purpose - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have been implemented in most organizations for a few years. ERP solutions go through three phases of lifecycle: selection, implementation and operation phase; the operation phase consists of the stabilization stage and the routine stage. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ERP system use in the operation phase, organizations need to research the factors that have impact on users' satisfaction. A literature shows that few published studies have examined users' adoption of ERP systems through a technological acceptance model (TAM) or examined external factors that have influence the intention to use an ERP system, or ERP use in the stabilization stage. The purpose of this paper is to expose and research external factors which have influence on ERP users in the operation phase of ERP lifecycle and to investigate the impact of those factors on ERP system use. Design/methodology/approach - The TAM proposed by Davis has been the most widely-used model for researching user acceptance and usage of information technology/information systems. Despite the existence of several additions to TAM connected with ERP use, the authors aim to make further contribution in the area of external factors. Within this context the present research is focused on the mature use of ERP system (more than one year of ERP use in an organization). A limited number of external factors mentioned in already published papers connected with TAM regarding ERP use has also been extended. The authors have researched the effect of external factors through the second-order factors on the original TAM. The model has been empirically tested using the data collected from a survey of 161 ERP users from a national telecom company, which has been using an ERP system since 1999. The model has been analysed using PLS approach. Findings - The study shows that extended external factors observed through the second-order factors have important influence on ERP usefulness and ERP ease of use; they also have a strong influence on the attitude toward using ERP system by ERP users in the routine (maturity) stage. Originality/value - The paper researches the factors which have an impact on ERP solution use in the routine(mature) stage of ERP lifecycle. The paper adds to the literature, in that few previous studies have examined the users' adoption of ERP systems through the TAM or examined external factors that have influence on the intention to use an ERP system or ERP use in the stabilization stage.	gbr	Embankment Press Limited	2011	1.01	Industrial management + data systems	1.472	1.05
10794262	Sensor for injection rate measurements	A vast majority of the medium and high speed Diesel engines are equipped with multi-hole injection nozzles nowadays. Inaccuracies in workmanship and changing hydraulic conditions in the nozzles result in differences in injection rates between individual injection nozzle holes. The new deformational measuring method described in the paper allows injection rate measurement in each injection nozzle hole. The differences in injection rates lead to uneven thermal loads of Diesel engine combustion chambers. All today known measuring method, such as Bosch and Zeuch give accurate results of the injection rate in diesel single-hole nozzles. With multihole nozzles they tellus nothing about possible differences in injection rates between individual holes of the nozzle. At deformational measuring method, the criterion of the injected fuel is expressed by the deformation of membrane occurring due to the collision of the pressure wave against the membrane. The pressure wave is generated by the injection of the fuel into the measuring space. For each hole of the nozzle the measuring device must have a measuring space of its own into which fuel is injected as well as its measuring membraneand its own fuel outlet. During measurements procedure the measuring space must be filled with fuel to maintain an overpressure of 5 kPa. Fuel escaping from the measuring device is conducted into the graduated cylinders for measuring the volumetric flow through each hole of the nozzle.The membrane deformation is assessed by strain gauges. They are glued to the membrane and forming the full Wheatstoneæs bridge. We devoted special attention to the membrane shape and temperature compensation of the strain gauges.	che	MDPI	2006	1.01	Sensors	1.373	0.99

The magnetically nonlinear characteristics are determined by controlled magnetic excitation of all three limbs which allows to take into account the variable magnetic-cross couplings between different coils placed on limbs, caused by saturation. The corresponding partial derivatives of measured flux linkage characteristics are used in the transformer circuit model as a magnetically nonlinear iron core model in order to analyze the behaviour of a nonsymmetrically excited transformer. Numerical results using transformer model with the determined iron core model agree very well with the measured results.	nld	North-Holland Publishing	2006	1.01	Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials	1.212	1.659

Further, invariance analysis shows that no significant differences exist in relationships among perceived quality, image, perceived value and satisfaction between tourists from Slovenia and tourists from Italy.	hrv	Institut drutvenih znanosti Ivo Pilar	2011	1.01	Drutvena istraivanja	0.152	0.966
1081151	Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in patients with atrial arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction, treated with streptokinase	Atrial arrhythmias (AA), especially atrial fibrillation (AF), during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are often associated with increased mortality and heart failure. Impaired fibrinolysis with elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity is associated with resistance to fibrinolytic therapy in AMI patients, but it is also found in patients with AF. Our aim was a prospective study of the role of pre-treatment PAI-1 levels for the presence of AA in AMI patients and the influence of AA on in-hospital mortality. In 116 AMI patients, treated with streptokinase, pre-treatment PAI-1 levels were estimated by the chromogenic method (normal levels, 0.3-3.5 Uml) and in-hospital AA were assessed as atrial fibrillation, flutter and/or tachycardias. Between patients with and without AA, a significant difference was observed in mean pre-treatment PAI-1 levels, in several in-hospital complications and mortality (24 versus 4.4%; P < 0.01; odds ratio, 6.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-25.0). The PAI-1 level > 7 U/ml was the most significant independent pre-treatment risk factor for AA (P < 0.05; odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-10.6). We conclude that AA were a significant risk for in-hospital mortality of AMI patients, treated with streptokinase. A pre-treatment PAI-1 level > 7 U/ml was the most significant pre-treatment risk for AA in these patients.	gbr	Rapid Communications	2002	1.01	Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis	1.588	2.362
10812438	Utilization of municipal solid waste bottom ash and recycled aggregate in concrete	In the combustion process of municipal solid waste (MSW), bottom ash (BA) represents the major portion of the solid residue. Since BA is composed of oxides, especially SiO2 and CaO, the feasibility of its application in concrete as a substitute for cement was tested. It was found that at the age of 28 days, the flexural and compressive strengths of the binder linearly decrease at the rate of 0.03 and 0.02 MPa per wt% of BA in the binder, respectively. According to the results it may be recommended to replace up to 15 wt% of cement by BA and to use such binder where a low strength of concreteelements is required. Furthermore, the aggregate used for low strengthconcrete need not be of a very good quality. Therefore, gravel aggregate was partially replaced by recycled aggregate (RA). Consistency measured by slump was significantly reduced (>50%) when BA or/and RA were introduced into the mixture. However, concrete density and compressive strength were not affected and were 2300 kg/m3 and 40 MPa, respectively.	nld	Pergamon	2006	1.01	Waste management	1.223	1.186
1081449	Design of a series visco-elastic actuator for multi-purpose rehabilitation haptic device	Background. Variable structure parallel mechanisms, actuated with low-cost motors with serially added elasticity (series elastic actuator - SEA), has considerable potential in rehabilitation robotics. However, reflected masses of a SEA and variable structure parallel mechanism linked with a compliant actuator result in a potentially unstable coupled mechanical oscillator, which has not been addressed in previous studies. Methods. The aim of this paper was to investigate through simulation, experimentation and theoretical analysis the necessary conditions that guarantee stability and passivity of a haptic device (based on a variable structure parallel mechanism driven by SEA actuators) when in contact with a human. We have analyzed an equivalent mechanical system where a dissipative element, a mechanical damper was placed in parallel to a spring in SEA. Results. The theoretical analysis yielded necessary conditions relating the damping coefficient, spring stiffness, both reflected masses, controller's gain and desired virtual impedance that needs to be fulfilled in order to obtain stable and passive behavior of the device when in contact with a human. The validity of the derived passivity conditions were confirmed in simulations and experimentally. Conclusions. These results show that by properly designing variable structure parallel mechanisms actuated with SEA, versatile and affordable rehabilitation robotic devices can be conceived, which may facilitate their wide spread use in clinical and home environments.	gbr	BioMed Central	2011	1.01	Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation	3.264	1.549
10815771	Detection of cavitation in operation of kinetic pumps	Safe operation of kinetic pumps, as liquid movers, can be threatened by cavitation phenomenon in, amongst others. Cavitation is the Achilles' heel of kinetic pumps. It can cause deterioration of the hydraulic performance, damage of the pump by pitting and material erosion, and structure vibration and noise. Cavitation can appear within the entire range of operating conditions, therefore it must by all means be prevented. To prevent cavitation in a pump we have to know the beginning and development of the cavitation in the pump. For this purpose, the emitted noise in the audible range can be used, amongst other possibilities. Experiments have shown that there is a discrete frequency tone within the audible noise spectra, which is in strong correlation with development of the cavitation process in the pump. Therefore, the discrete frequency tone can be separated from the noise spectra of a cavitating pump and used to detect the incipient of cavitation and its development as well as to prevent the onset of the cavitation process in the pump, by means of initiating an alarm, shutdown, or control signal via an electrical control system.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2009	1.01	Applied acoustics	0.784	1.068

Extensive simulations have shown that adjustments in the push off related parameter on higher between-step control level after each step enable evolution of various walking modes of the biped walker at selected walking speeds and distinctive gait patterns. It also allows us to investigate the changes in gait kinematics and kinetics of the biped walking model due to changes in gait velocity, torso inclination and propulsion distribution profiles.	nld	Elsevier	2011	1.01	Simulation modelling practice and theory	0.969	0.978

10819867	A method for rapid measurement of laser ablation rate of hard dental tissue	The aim of the study reported here is the development of a new method which allows rapid and accurate in-vitro measurements of three-dimensional (3D) shape of laser ablated craters in hard dental tissues and the determination of crater volume, ablation rate and speed. The method is based on the optical triangulation principle. A laser sheet projector illuminates the surface of a tooth, mounted on a linear translation stage. As the tooth is moved by the translation stage a fast digital video camera captures series of images of theilluminated surface. The images are analyzed to determine a 3D model of the surface. Custom software is employed to analyze the 3D model and to determine the volume of the ablated craters. Key characteristics of the method are discussed as well as some practical aspects pertinent to its use. The method has been employed in an in-vitro study to examine the ablation rates and speeds of the two main laser types currently employed in dentistry, Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG. Ten samples of extracted human molar teeth were irradiated with laser pulse energies from 80 mJ to the maximum available energy (970 mJ with the Er:YAG, and 260 mJ with the Er,Cr:YSGG). About 2000 images of each ablated tooth surface have been acquired along a translation range of 10 mm, taking about 10 s and providing close to 1 million surface measurement points. Volumes of 170 ablated craters (half of them in dentine and the other half in enamel) were determined from this data and used to examine the ablated volume per pulse energy and ablation speed. The results show that, under the same conditions, the ablated volume per pulse energy achieved by the Er:YAG laser exceeds that of the Er,Cr:YSGG laser in almost all regimes for dentine and enamel. The maximum Er:YAG laser ablation speeds (1.2 mm3/s in dentine and 0.7 mm3/s in enamel) exceed those obtained by the Er,Cr:YSGG laser (0.39 mm3/s in dentine and 0.12 mm3/s in enamel).

The modulation depth of temperature induced loss and the operational temperature range of individual sensors in the network are set by the rotational alignment of fibers before fusion splicing and through fine adjustment of the sensing fiber lengths. A practical sensor network was built with sensors that operated in the temperature range from 0 to 100 C. Individual sensors in the network generatedtemperature dependent loss that changed proportionally from 0.9 to 1.8 dB. With current standard telecommunication OTDRs, more than 20 prototype sensors could be interrogated.	usa	Optical Society of America	2006	1.01	Optics express	4.009	1.239
10830876	A twenty-first century assessment of values across the global workforce	This article provides current Schwartz Values Survey (SVS) data from samples of business managers and professionals across 50 societies that are culturally and socioeconomically diverse. We report the society scores for SVS values dimensions for both individual- and societal-level analyses. At the individual-level, we report on the ten circumplex values sub-dimensions and two sets of values dimensions (collectivism and individualism; openness to change, conservation, self-enhancement, and self-transcendence). At the societal-level, we report on the values dimensions of embeddedness, hierarchy, mastery, affective autonomy, intellectual autonomy, egalitarianism, and harmony. For each society, we report the Cronbach's ? statistics for each values dimension scale to assess their internal consistency (reliability) as well as report interrater agreement (IRA) analyses to assess the acceptability of using aggregated individual level values scores to represent country values. We also examined whether societal development level is related to systematic variation in the measurement and importance of values. Thus, the contributions of our evaluation of the SVS values dimensions are two-fold. First, we identify the SVS dimensions that have cross-culturally internally reliable structures and within-society agreement for business professionals. Second, we report the society cultural values scores developed from the twenty-first century data that can be used as macro-level predictors in multilevel and single-level international business research.	nld	Kluwer Academic Publishers	2011	1.01	Journal of business ethics	0.963	0.831

10835227	Comparison of alternative approaches of single point incremental forming processes	Incremental sheet metal forming is becoming an attractive technology for fast prototyping and small batch production of sheet metal parts. The majority of investigations are focused on the use of a rigid tool to incrementally form the sheet metal into a final shape. An interesting alternative is to substitute the rigid tool with a high velocity water jet (WJ). The comparison between using a rigid tool and a WJ shows that each method has its advantages and disadvantages. This investigation is aimed to identify the most influential parameters affecting the forming process through experimental comparison of the two observed methods. Technological windows based on non-dimensional values and relevant process parameters like force on the rigid tool and water pressure were defined.	nld	Elsevier	2009	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	1.420	1.067

Jones & M. Clements (dark banded greenhood orchid) from southwestern Australia. Seeds were germinated symbiotically in vitro on an oatmeal agar (OMA) in the presence of a mycorrhizal fungus isolated from the orchid host. Ten week-old seedlings were transferred into culture vessels containing OMA supplemented with JA (at concentrations 0, 0.1, 1, 5 or 10 microM), sucrose (at concentrations 0, 5, 10 or 20 g 1-1) or combinations of each. Tuber development in all treatments occurred approximately twenty-six weeks after seed sowing. The addition of 5 or 10 g 1-1 sucrose with JA to the media resulted in higherè frequencies of tuber formation in comparison to the control. Significantly higher proportion of seedlings produced tuber when the medium was supplemented with 5 g 1-1 sucrose in combination with 5 microM JA, compared to the control. In vitro tuber formation of Pterostylis sanguinea canbe improved by combined addition of appropriate levels of JA and sucrose toOMA, which will aid in rapid in vitro tuberisation of terrestrial orchids.	nld	Nijhoff;Junk;Kluwer Academic Publishers	2002	1.01	Plant growth regulation	0.850	1.444

The analysis uses systems theory for analysing dynamic change in society and a synthesis of its influences on business education, as we see the Bologna Process is neither conceived nor implemented with sufficient care for holism in the European effort to become an innovative society. Business schools should extend their transformation effort beyond the Bologna Process and align their strategic model of operation with societal needs by integrating social requirements into their strategic framework. Research focuses on key external developments in business education at a transnational level. Future research should focus on the exploration of the business school response to social change in a local context. Emerging social challenges in Europe are taken as the starting point for realigning a strategic model of business school operation with societal needs and the business world with the aim to improve with innovative approaches schools' accountability and their evolvement into socially engaged actors. The paper presents a systemic and requisitely holistic view of social change for aligning the business school model of operation with the broader needs of a knowledge-driven society that stretches beyond the formal academic structures unification in Bologna Process.	svn	MCB university press	2011	1.01	Kybernetes	0.240	1.153

10861851	Multiple parametric models of heat transfer in lightweight building elements with ventilated cavities	Lightweight building elements (LBEs) with one or two ventilated cavities are multifunctional building-envelope elements that lower the heat transfer to theambient and enable solar heating. In the case of two ventilated cavities they operate as recuperative heat exchangers in the buildingæs ventilation system. This paper presents the development of a calculation procedure for thecharacterisation of such innovative building-envelope elements. Using a commercial numerical tool, a wide range of influential parameters was studied.Based on the numerical results, multiple parametrical models (MPMs) for determining an effective U-value and the heat gains on the supply of ventilation air were developed for the case of an LBE with one ventilated cavity, meanwhile MPMs for calculating the effective U-value and the heat-recovery rate were developed for an LBE with two ventilated cavities. Such MPMs can be integrated into well-known computer tools for buildingsæ energy-efficiency simulations, for example, TRNSYS.

10862107	Advances in water power-control hydraulics experimental research	Environmental protection regulations are becoming increasingly strict. By using water instead of a hydraulic mineral oil in power-control hydraulic systems we can make a very positive step in complying with these regulations. However, introducing the water instead of oil in power control hydraulics is rather novel and difficult task. Moreover, due to several specifics of water that are also discussed in this paper, several requirements need to be fulfilled in every test rig and test specimen. In this paper we present a newly developed hydraulic test rig that is designed for these specific requirements of water as the hydraulic fluid in power control hydraulics. For direct comparison with oil system, the test rig is designed as a twin system with two equivalent circuits: one for water and one for oil tests. Some interesting results on dynamic response of both systems are presented. They show significant differences between the water and oil hydraulics. With these experiments, the test rig proved the suitability for the research in this new area and showed a good control of the parameters measured.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2008	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.235	0.986

The existing cover of the suction unit was designed, taking into account only the geometrical requirements. Two different methods were used for characterization of the vibration and structural noise of the cover: numerical modal analysis made with the FEM (Finite Element Method) and experimental modal analysis made during the operation of the suction unit. The results of the experimental modal analysis of the coveræs vibrations visually confirmed the results of a numerical modal analysis up to the 1st BPF (Blade Passing Frequency) and characterized the main exciting sources with the prevailing aerodynamic excitation. The vibration modal analysis tries to find a relation with the coveræs structural noise using an experimental local noise modal analysis.

10862614	Combined edge detection using wavelet transform and signal registration	This paper presents a novel edge detection algorithm, using Haar wavelet transform and signal registration. The proposed algorithm has two stages: (a) adaptive edge detection with the maximum entropy thresholding technique on time-scale plane and (b) edge linkage into a con tour line with signal registration in order to c1ose edge discontinuities and calculate a confidence index for contour linkages. This index measures the level of confidence in the linkage of two adjacent points in the con tour structure. Experimenting with synthetic images, we found out the lower level of confidence can be set to approximately e-2. The method was tested on 200 synthetic images at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and II clinical images. We assessed its reliability, accuracy and robustness using the mean absolute distance (MAD) metric and our confidence index. The results for MAD on synthetic images yield the mean of 0.7 points and standard deviation (std) of 0.14, while the mean confidence level is 0.48 with std of 0.19 (the values are averaged over SNRs from 3 to 50 dB each in 20 Monte-Carlo runs). Our assessment on clinical images, where the references were expert's annotations, give MAD equal1.36:1:: 0.36 (mean :1:: std) and confidence level equal 0.67 :1:: 0.25 (mean :1:: std).	nld	Butterworth Scientific	2006	1.01	Image and vision computing	1.171	0.937
10862619	Cylindrical wormgearings with progressively curved shape of teeth flanks	A wormgearing or a worm gear set, featuring concavely shaped worm contact flanks and convex worm gear teeth is proposed in this paper. Corresponding flank profiles are defined by a mathematical function enabling progressive curvatures of profiles. This function is used to define a basic worm profile in the axial plane, wherefrom worm flank surface and mating worm gear profile and flank surface are derived. Furthermore, cutting tools for manufacturing such wormgearing are defined. Kinematic circumstances are discussed in detail,thus disclosing the emergence of contact lines (surfaces). The essential characteristics of the proposed wormgearing are that its entire teeth flank surfaces in contact are involved in power transmission and that concave-convex contacts exist anywhere on flank surfaces. Thus, improved properties in power transmission and lubrication can be expected, consequentlyresulting in lower energy losses and lower wear.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969

10869531	Characterization of incipient cavitation in axial valve by hydrophone and visualization	As the effects of cavitation in valves are devastating, the choice of the correct valve for a given operating range is crucial. For this, the valve characteristic is needed, whereby one side of the operating range depends on the determination of the incipient cavitation. In this paper, the visualization method for incipient cavitation detection is presented. For the purpose of comparison, pressure oscillations inside the pipeline were simultaneously measured with a hydrophone. The effect of operating pressure was studied for two different openings of the valve. For each operating point of incipient cavitation, corresponding points were measured for developed cavitation and no-cavitation state, based on a constant-portion change of volumetric flow rate with regard to the incipient cavitation volumetric flow rate. The visualization and hydrophone signals were compared. The visualization method proved efficiency over hydrophone measurements because itis more sensitive to cavitation and the signal is independent of the operating pressure. The main drawback is the preparation of the observation window.	usa	Elsevier Science Publ.	2009	1.01	ETF science	1.234	0.969
10871579	Quality improvement of flame sprayed, heat treated, and remelted NiCrBSi coatings	In this study, properties of NiCrBSi coatings, produced by a two-step process of flame deposition and furnace posttreatment, are analyzed. Adhesion strength, microstructure, porosity, microhardness, chemical composition, and residual stresses were analyzed after deposition and after heat treatment; that is, remelting. Numerous specimens were made to study the adhesion strength of coatings after flame deposition. The four chosen influential factors, that is, surface roughness, preheat temperature of the substrate, distance of flame torch, and type of oxyacetylene flame, were optimized to maximize the adhesion strength, using the Taguchi parametric method. The confirmation experiment showed that the developed experimental model is suitable for optimization of flame spraying deposition process. Based on the evaluation of coating properties, the best overall quality was obtained after remelting at a peak temperature 1080 °C with 5 minutes of holding time, followed by slow air cooling.	usa	ASM International	2009	1.01	Journal of thermal spray technology	1.338	1.184
10874390	Reduced conductive EMI in switched-mode DC-DC power converters without EMI filters: PWM versus randomized PWM	This paper addresses improved electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) in switched-mode power converters (SMPCs), without using electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters. A practical solution is proposed for minimizing conductive EMI in a pulsewidth modulated (PWM), and random PWM dc-dc power converters. A comparative investigation is performed into the use of differentrandom modulation schemes (driven by the DSP-2 board with the TMS320C32) as against the normal PWM. The effectiveness of randomization on spreading those dominating frequencies that normally exist in constant frequency PWM schemes is evaluated by power spectral density (PSD) estimations in the low-frequency range. Some parasitical- and topology-based EMI sources in devices are presented and frequency analysis is shown by using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). SPICE simulations are also used to verify practical solutions for eliminating negative EMI sources and achieving EMC improvements. Finally, levels of conductive EMI are estimated with DFT, and experimentally verified to comply with the CISPR 25 (or EN 55025) regulations. Moreover, it is clearly shown, that limited speed PWM driving of the power switches with appropriate snubber circuits guarantees reduced conductive EMI. When considering the price and high EMC, in the final solutionthe power converter is driven by the u-controller PIC16F876 with limited numerical and peripheral capabilities, where only normal PWM and randomized PWM can be implemented.	usa	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2006	1.01	IEEE transactions on power electronics	1.029	0.942

To determine the cadmium content in the most frequently consumed foods ofplant origin, assess the cadmium content in the biological materials (blood,hair) of the Slovenian young males, and verify the hypothesis that the cadmium pollution of the environment varies regionally in Slovenia, which willalso reflect in the cadmium content in the biological materials researched. Methods. We analzyed 982 composite samples of plant origin foods. The cadmiumburden in the population was assessed by analzying the cadmium content in biological materials (full blood, hair) of randomly selected healthz males,18-26 zears of age. Results. According to the regions where the foods were produced, the differences in the cadmium burden were statistically significant (p=0.0005). The median cadmium content in the blood (N=463) was 0.5 g/L. The median cadmium content in the hair (N=245) was 4 ng/g. Varzing with the region of permanent residence, the differences in cadmium content varied statisticallz significant in the blood (p<0.0005) and hair samples (p<0.003) as well. Cadmium burden in plant origin foods and the cadmium content in the blood showed only a weak correlation (Spearman's rho=0.13). The correlation between the cadmium foods and the cadmium content in the hair, however, is much stronger (Spearman's rho =0.55). Conclusion. Our research confirm the hypothesis of regional variation of cadmium in the environment, and connection with the cadmium burden in the population of those regions.	hrv	Medicinska naklada	2003	1.01	Croatian medical journal online	0.943	2.111
10882587	Machine learning induction of a model for online parameter selection in EDM rough machining	In electrical discharge machining (EDM), appropriate average current in the gap has to be selected for the given machining surface in order to obtain the highest material removal rate at low electrode wear. Thus, rough machining parameters have to be selected according to the machining surface. In the caseof sculptured features, the machining surface varies with the depth of machining. Hence, the machining parameters have to be selected online to obtain appropriate current density in the gap. In this paper, inductive machine learning is used to derive a model based on the voltage and current inthe gap. The sufficient inputs to the model are only two discharge attributes extracted from the voltage signal in the gap. The model successfully selects between two machining parameter settings that obtain different average surface current in the gap. It requires only voltage signal acquisition during the machining process and a simple algorithm that is easy to implement on industrial machines.	gbr	IFS Publications	2009	1.01	International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	1.128	1.067

To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) response of uncontrolled capsular glaucoma (CG) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) to selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in a prospective clinical trial. Methods. Ten eyes of ten patients suffering from uncontrolled CG (CG Group) and ten eyes of ten patients with uncontrolled POAG (POAG Group) were treated with a frequency-doubled, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser (532 nm). The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. IOP was measured before and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after treatment. Success was defined as IOP more than 20% lower than before treatment. Any change of hypotensive medication led to the subjects' exclusion from the study. The two groups were compared using the independent-sample t test for continuous variables and the log-rank test for survival analysis. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant. Results. The mean follow-up was 12.0 months (SD 5.5) for the CG group and 13.5 months (SD 4.3) for POAG (n.s.). No significant difference was found between the two groups for mean pretreatment IOP (23.6 mmHg +/- 5.70 in the CG group and 22.8 mmHg +/- 2.44 in the POAG group) or for mean IOP and mean IOP reductions during the follow-up. At all follow-up visits, IOP was reduced less in the CG group than in the POAG group (24.8% +/- 11.15 vs. 27.7% +/- 9.91 at 6 months, 22.0% +/- 6.66 vs. 30.6% +/- 6.35 at 12 months, and 31.4% +/- 5.55 vs. 35.1% +/- 1.75 at 18 months), but the difference was significant only at 12 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis gave an 18-month success rate of 64% in the CG group and 78% in the POAG group, with no significant differences between the groups. Conclusions. SLT is an effective procedure for lowering IOP in CG and POAG eyes, although the effect seems to last less in CG eyes.	ita	Wichtig editore	2002	1.01	European journal of ophthalmology	0.483	1.339

10898715	Time dependant measurements of cavitation damage	Due to the extremely long length of experiments, in most studies of cavitationerosion only damage in the incubation period is measured and the final damage (mass loss rate) is then predicted by extrapolation. The methods of extrapolation are usually very basic since there were almost no in depth time dependant measurements of cavitation erosion performed in the past. A rotating disc test rig that generates a very aggressive cavitation and pure copper specimens, as erosion sensors, were used to investigate the correlationbetween the damage within the incubation period and final mass loss. The damage was measured optically three times during the incubation period and by weighing the specimen during the rest of the experiment. The results confirmed that the same clear relationship between the damage in the incubation period and the final mass loss rate exists, what means, that the mass loss rate can indeed be qualitatively predicted on the basis of measurements performed within the incubation period. This is a good basis for developing laws of extrapolation from a short time scale (laboratory measurement within the incubation period) to the real time scale (machine operation).	che	Elsevier	2009	1.01	Wear	1.771	0.969

The region near the trailing edge of the hollow airfoil was studied in detail and measurements of velocity and turbulence intensities were performed with hot-wire anemometry. Determination of flow structure on the hollow airfoil was performed with computer-aided visualization. It can be concluded from the measurement analysis that higher values of velocities, lower turbulence intensities and a significant decrease of circulation effects on the suction side of the hollow blade were achieved, due to the introduction of internal flow. The results obtained on the hollow airfoil were applied on the rotating axial fan. Influence of the internal flowof the hollow blade on the flow field of the axial fan was studied. With the introduction of the internal flow a reduction of circulation effects on the fan hollow blade was achieved. Aerodynamic characteristic of the axial fanreached higher degree of total pressure difference and normalized efficiency through the entire fan working conditions.	usa	Elsevier Science Publ.	2009	1.01	ETF science	1.234	0.969
10912539	Numerical and experimental investigation of axial fan with trailing edge self-induced blowing	Axial fans often showadverseflowconditions at the fan hub and at the tip of the blades. In the present paper, amodification of conventional axial fan blades with numerical and experimental investigation is presented. Hollow blades were manufactured from the hub to the trailing edge at the tip of the blades. They enable the formation of self-induced internal flow through internal passages. The internal flow enters the internal radial flowpassages of the hollowblades through the openings near the fan hub and exits through the trailing edge slots at the tip of the blade. The study of the influence ofinternal flow on the flow field of axial fan and the modifications of aerodynamic characteristics of the axial fan have been made. The numerical andexperimental results show a comparison of integral and local characteristics of the axial fan with the internal flow, compared to characteristics of a geometrically equivalent fan without internal flow. The experimental results of local characteristics were performed with a five-hole probe and computer-aided visualization.Areduction of adverse flowconditions near the trailing edge at the tip of the blade was achieved, as well as boundary layer reduction on the blade suction side and the reduction of flow separation. The introduction of self-induced blowing led to the preservation of the direction of external flow, defined by blade geometry, and enabledmaximal local energy conversion. The integral characteristic reached higher degree of efficiency.	deu	VDI-Verlag GmbH	2009	1.01	Forschung im Ingenieurwesen	0.391	0.918
10916360	Birhythmicity, trirhythmicity and chaos in bursting calcium oscillations	We have analyzed various types of complex calcium oscillations. The oscillations. The oscillations are explained with a model based on calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). In addition to the endoplasmic reticulum as the main intracellular Ca2+ store, mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ binding proteins are also taken into account. This model was previously proposed for the study of the physiological role of mitochondria and the cytosolic proteins in gene rating complex Ca2 oscillations [1]. Here, we investigated the occurrence of different types of Ca2+ oscillations obtained by the model, i. e. simple oscillations, bursting, and chaos. In a bifurcation diagram, we have shown that all these various modes of oscillatory behaviour are obtained by a change of only one model parameter, which corresponds to the physiological variability of an agonist. Bursting oscillations were studied in more detail because they express birhythmicity, trirhythmicity and chaotic bahavior. Two different routes to chaos are observed in the model: in addition to the usual period doubling cascade, we also show intermittency. For the characterization of the chaotic behavior, we made use of return maps and Lyapunov exponents. The potential biological role of chaos in intracellular signaling is discussed.

10919195	Autonomous on-line system for fracture identification at incremental sheet forming	Before starting, the production forming processes require real experiments in order to accurately define forming limits. For this reason and because incremental sheet metal forming technology requires a relatively long production time, an autonomous on-line system for fracture identification has been developed. The system is a versatile tool for the identification of the location and time of the occurrence of the fracture, without human influences or oversight. The system is based on an investigation of the forming forces, responsive to very small variations, appearing during the forming process, andworks effectively with different material types, material thicknesses and product shapes.	che	Technische Rundschau;Hallwag Verlag;Colibri	2009	1.01	CIRP annals	1.603	1.067
1092201	Time trends in ability level and functional outcome of stroke and multiple sclerosis patients undergoing comprehensive rehabilitation in Slovenia	Background: The University Rehabilitation Institute in Ljubljana provides comprehensive rehabilitation for the whole territory of Slovenia. The aim of the study was to verify a clinical observation that the demandingness of rehabilitation has been increasing because of a decrease in patients' functional abilitites on admission, with rehabilitation outcomes having remained unchanged or even improved. Methods: Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores of 651 cerebrovascular insult (CVI) and 151 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients gathered between September 2004 and September 2006 (all eligible cases) were compared with those for patients with the same diagnosis (N=144 and 74, respectively) collected during the period from September 1999 to September 2000 (a random sample), considering only first-admission cases. The average FIM (motor, cognitive and total) scores and FIM gain after rehabilitation during the two periods were determined for each diagnostic group adjusted for patient age. Rehabilitation efficiency and effectiveness levels were compared in the same way. Effect Size and Standardised Response Mean were also analysed. Results: There were no differences in gender structure of the groups between the periods studied. During the recent period,the average age was higher by around two years in both groups. The length of stay was marginally shortened for CVI patients and remained unchanged for MS patients. There were no differences between the two periods concerning the time elapsed since stroke. In both groups, admission motor and cognitive FIM scores were on average approximately five points lower in the recent period, while the average rehabilitation gain from admission to discharge increased over time (in total by 1 in CVI patients and by 3 in MS patients). Regarding motor and total FIM scores, the standardised gain, rehabilitation efficiency and rehabilitation effectiveness increased as well. Conclusions: The Institute is admitting more severely affected patients than it did five to ten years ago, and parallelly the patient age has increased. Despite that and notwithstanding the tendency towards shorter rehabilitation, expected age-adjusted functional independence gain, rehabilitation efficiency, rehabilitation effectiveness, and the standardised functional independence gain have increased.	svn	Intitut za varovanje zdravja Republike Slovenije	2011	1.01	Zdravstveno varstvo	0.452	1.491

10936347	On the modeling of vibration transmission over a spatially curved cable with casing	We propose an approach to the vibration modeling of spatially curved steel wires with a casing and a contact between the outer casing and the inner steelwire. For the mathematical model of the steel wire and the outer casing, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with no axial pre-load is used, and for the discretisation, finite elements are used. The excitation of the steel wire andthe outer casing is in the form of random kinematic excitation. For the energy dissipation the proportional viscous damping model and the structural damping model are used. The damping parameters are identified from the Nyquistdiagram and from the continuous wavelet transform. For the identification of the frequency dependence of the dynamic modulus of elasticity a method is proposed that uses the measured natural frequencies andthe experimentally determined natural modes. The contact between the steel wire and the outer casing is modelled using the penalty method with the friction in a tangential direction. We show that higher values of the frictioncoefficient have a significant influence on lowering the level of vibration transmission. The model also predicts that the dynamic modulus of the elasticity of a steel wire does not have a major influence on the level ofvibration transmission, which was also validated by experiment. On the basisof an experimental validation the model of a steel wire with an outer casing proved to be suitable for the prediction of the vibration transmission.	gbr	Academic Press	2009	1.01	Journal of Sound and Vibration	1.414	0.969

Using this approach the damping forces are usually neglected and only the elastic forces are taken into account. The aim of this paper is to introduce a damping mechanism into the belt-drive model and to verify it against experimental data. Different damping mechanisms are proposed for the damping of the longitudinal and bending deformations and several experiments were conducted in order to obtain the damping properties. Good agreement between the numerical result and the experimentally obtained data was found. Finally, the applicability of the belt-drive model was presented in a comparison with the pinned-pinned beam model.	gbr	Academic Press	2009	1.01	Journal of Sound and Vibration	1.414	0.969

10943516	A holistic project-knowledge society as a condition for solving global strategic crises	This article emphasizes the role of projects and project management in mastering global strategic crises to create a new multi-project environment, comprised of projects, programs, and project portfolios. Multi-projectivity has come to characterize modern society and requires an adjustment of organizational solutions, individual competencies of different systems, and changes in understanding the effects of a project. The current global strategic crises are identified; some call for urgent, systemic and global solutions involving the implementation of projects with the awareness that the necessary and project-influenced resources are limited. The article examines the knowledge society in the context of global strategic crises and expands previous interpretations of project-oriented society, stressing its role in overcoming global strategic crises. By expanding and integrating the knowledge society and the project-oriented society, the a uthors propose the establishment of a holistic project-knowledge society that sets the framework for overcoming global strategic crises, thereby ensuring the longterm survival of humankind.

This study emphasizes the influence of welding parameters and post-welding precipitation annealing heat treatment on the welds&apos; mechanical and metallurgical properties. A series of U-groovedspecimens of 1.2344 tool steel is prepared. These grooves are filled with 1.6356 maraging steel as filler wire using multi-pass Gas Tungsten Arc welding. The metallurgical properties of the filler welds, in the as-welded condition and after precipitation annealing with a series of different parameters, are studied. The influence of preheat temperature, heat input during welding, and hot working of maraging steel welds is evaluated regardingmechanical and metallurgical properties. The response surface models for the prediction of mechanical properties (i.e. hardness, toughness, tensilestrength, and yield stress after post-welding heat treatment) are developed. The results show that metallurgical and mechanical properties significantly depend on welding technology and post-welding heat treatment parameters. Gas Tungsten Arc welding with low heat input permits the omission of solution heat treatment after welding, while hot working of welds during welding increases the mechanical properties.

It was found that the constructed wetland model reduced dye concentration by up to 70%, lowered the TOC and COD values up to 88%, electrical conductivity up to 60% and pH from 12 to 7.6.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Dyes and pigments	2.796	0.674
10946843	Tribological behavior of tungsten-doped DLC coating under oil lubrication	Diamond-like carbon (DLC) protective films have received considerable attention in recent years. Beside tools and dies, diamond-like and related coatings are starting to find application in some highly stressed mechanical components, including bearings and gears. Several different gear tests show anincrease in carrying load capacity or prolonged lifetime with tungsten carbide-doped DLC (W-DLC)-coated gears. The lubricants have been mostly commercially available gear oils that were primarily developed or tailored forferrous materials and are probably far from optimal for amorphous W-DLC layers. In the present work, the influence of lubricant chemistry on the friction and wear in W-DLC-coated contacts was investigated using a reciprocating test device. The first six test lubricants were conventional non-inhibited API/ATIEL base stocks followed by selected test blends in combination with different surface-active single additives. Experimental results in coated contact have shown that for friction reduction performance, additives are not necessary, while wear resistance is related with the chemistry of the lubricant. It may be concluded at this stage that different mechanisms of friction-induced interaction between lubricants and W-DLC-coatedlayers are possible.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Limited	2009	1.01	Tribology international	1.690	0.969
10947099	Detection of cavitation in situ operation of kinetic pumps	Cavitation within a pump causes structural vibration with noise, among other by-products. Experiments have shown that there is a discrete frequency or broadband peak within the audible noise spectra, which is in strong correlation with the development of the cavitation process in the pump. Furthermore, the peak of the discrete frequency, or broadband peak, coincides with the net positive suction head (NPSH) critical value, which corresponds toa 3% drop in the total delivery head. Therefore, the discrete frequency tonecan be used to detect the incipience of cavitation and its development as well as to determine the NPSH required or critical value with in situ operation of a pump. In this study, we wanted to clarify the mechanism of noise generation, which is responsible for the discrete frequency component and on which cavitation has an important effect. For this purpose, three different measurement methods were used: the first is based on measurement of the sound pressure level (SPL) in the surrounding air, the second is based on measurement of the underwater acoustics and the third is based on measurement of the structural vibration. Experiments have shown that the characteristic discrete frequency tone, which is in close correlation with the cavitation process, is a result of structural vibrations (modes) or resonances caused by implosion of bubbles and bombardment of the inner surfaces of the pump.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2009	1.01	Applied acoustics	0.784	1.068

Study design: In 72 patients with an adnexal cystic mass, transvaginal ultrasound guided cyst aspiration was performed. Before the procedure, presence of primary malignant disease was excluded by gynecologic and ultrasound examination. Cyst content was sent for cytological analysis. Cytological findings were staged according to Papanicolaou. Patients were re-examined 3 and 6 months after the ultrasound intervention. Cysts measuring 3 cm or more in diameter were considered to be recurrence of the disease. Results: Recurrence of the disease appeared in 32 cases (44%) and was more common with larger cysts. Malignant cells were found in one case (1.5%), a recurrent ovarian cancer, previously treated by surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion: In our study, ultrasound guided aspiration of adnexal cysts was not shown to be an efficient method of treatment because of the high recurrence rate. It may be used in selected patients at high anaesthesiologic risk for surgery as a therapeutic or a diagnostic procedure.	nld	Excerpta Medica	2002	1.01	European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology	0.854	1.357
1095015	Robustness of hollow clay masonry units and seismic behaviour of masonry walls	As a recent experimental investigations indicated, the robustness of masonry units is one among the most decisive parameters which define the behaviour of masonry walls when subjected to seismic loads. If local britte failure of units occurs, the mechanism of behaviour and known relationships between the strength and ductility proprties od masonry walls change. In such a case, the design values of load bearing and energy dissipation capacity of masonry walls are overestimated, although the equations and requirements specified in the codes have been taken into consideration. If brittle units are used for the construction of structural walls, the actual structure will be exposed to an increased level of seismic risk although it has been designed for earthquake loads according to codes. This is especially the case of reinforced masonry, where brittle local failure prevents the transfer of predicted forces from reinforcing steel to masonry units. In order to provide limitations for the use of hollow units with large hole volume ratio and thin shells amd webs in seismic areas, a measure to define the qualitstive term ""sufficient robustness"", specified in Eurocode 8, should be found.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific	2006	1.01	Construction & building materials	0.506	0.534
10952470	Modeling distributed real-time applications with specification PEARL	The methodology of hardware/software co-design of embedded control systems with Specification PEARL is presented. Hardware and software are modeled with the language Specification PEARL, which has its origins in standard Multiprocessor PEARL. Its usefulness is enhanced for modeling hierarchical and asymmetrical multiprocessor systems, and by additional parameters for schedulability analysis. Graphical symbols are introduced for its constructs to enable graphical modeling while maintaining the semantical background. It is meant to be a superlayer for programs, based on the PEARL programming model. To model program tasks, Timed State Transition Diagrams have been defined. The model of a co-designed system is verified for feasibility with co-simulation. The resulting information should be used when considering changes in a current design with the goal of producing a temporally feasible model. To support dynamic re-configurations, configuration management is introduced into the models. Since UML is becoming a de facto standard also for designing embedded control systems, and since Timed State Transition Diagrams and State Chart Diagrams share great similarity, an interface of the methodology to UML 2 is defined, using UML's extension mechanisms.	usa	Kluwer Academic Publishers	2007	1.01	Real-time systems	0.560	1.017
10953817	Graph colouring by maximal evidence edge adding	Graph colouring is one of the most studied NP-hard problems. Many problems of practical interest can be modelled as colouring problems. The basic colouring problem is to group items ai as few groups as posible, subject to the constraint that no incompatible items end up in the same group. Classical examples of applications include timetabling and scheduling. We describe an iterative heuristic algorithm for adding new edges to a graph in order to make the search for a colouring easier. The heuristic is used to decide which edges should be added by sampling a number of approximate colourings and adding edges which have fewest conflicts with the generated colourings. We perform some analysis of the number of approximate colourings that might be needed to give good bounds on the probability of including an edge which increases the chromatic number of the graph. Experimental results on a set of ""difficult graphs"" arising from scheduling problems are given.	gbr	Springer	2001	1.01	Lecture notes in computer science	0.415	0.634
10954267	A neural-network approach to describe the scatter of cyclic stress-strain curves	In order to predict a product's durability in the early phases of development it is necessary to know the stress-strain behaviour of the material, its resistance to fatigue and the loading states in the material. These parameters, however, tend to exhibit a considerable degree of uncertainty. Due to a lack of knowledge of the actual circumstances in which the product is used, during the early development phase, simulations based on statistical methods are used. The results of the experiments show that the cyclic stress-strain curves demonstrate not only a large amount of scatter, but also a dependence on the temperature, the size of the cross-section, the content of alloying elements, the loading rate, etc. This article presents a method for modelling cyclic stress-strain-curve scatter using a hybrid neural network for an arbitrary selection of the influencing factors. In an example of the measured data for a high pressure die-cast aluminium alloy it is clear that the suggested method is suitable for describing cyclic stress-strain curves. The main advantage of a hybrid neural network in comparison with a conventional method is the neural network's ability to precisely describe the influence of various factors, and their combinations, based on the form and scatter of the cyclic stress-strain-curve families. Defining the model parameters, i.e., training the neural network, is a procedure that does not require any additional user interventions; however, it enables us to gather knowledge that would otherwise require a lot of research. Thus, the trained neural network is a robust tool that can be used to predict cyclic stress-strain curves for random values of influencing factors. The capabilities of the presented method are only limited by the quantity of the measured data used for the neural-network training.	gbr	Scientific and Technical Press	2010	1.01	Materials and design	1.694	2.13
10954523	Analytical framework for analyzing the energy conversion efficiency of different hybrid electric vehicle topologies	Energy consumption and exhaust emissions of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) strongly depend on the HEV topology, power ratios of the components and applied control strategy. There are many available patterns of combining the power flows to meet load requirements making it difficult to analyze and evaluate a newly designed HEV. In order to enhance design of HEVs, the paper provides a stand alone analytical framework for evaluating energy conversion phenomena of different HEV topologies. Analytical analysis is based on the energy balance equations and considers the complete energy path in the HEVs from the energy sources to the wheels and to other energy sinks. The analytical framework enables structuring large amount of data in physically meaningful energy flows and associated energy losses, and therefore provides insightful information for HEV optimization. It therefore enables identification of most suitable HEV topology and of most suitable power ratiosof the components, since it reveals and quantifies the instruments that could lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of particular HEV. The analytical framework is also applicable for correcting the energy consumption of the HEV to the value corresponding to balanced energy content of the electric storage devices.	gbr	Pergamon	2009	1.01	Energy Conversion and Management	1.944	1.269
10955035	The Stribeck curve and lubrication design for non-fully wetted surfaces	Tailoring the properties of tribological interfaces is difficult, but it can be a very efficient way to reduce wear and friction and so increase service life - providing it can be done successfully. However, when considering the interface properties it is necessary not only to take into account the solid-solid contacts, we also need to consider the solid-liquid interfaces, which can have a very significant impact on the micro- and macro-contacts, andwhich cannot be neglected. In this investigation we show that it is essential to consider the wetting, or slip, properties of the non-fully wettedsurfaces when designing the lubrication, and that this is also to a large extent predictable and relatively simple to implement. We discuss the differences between several types of contacts, using steel and DLC as model materials for fully wetted and non-fully wetted surfaces, respectively. We studied steel/steel, steel/DLC and DLC/DLC pairs, and we present the experimental evidence for how the Stribeck curve changes if one or two surfaces in the contact are non-fully wetted. Firstly, in the EHL regime the friction of non-fully wetted surfaces decreases significantly; in our case by around 15% and by more than 20%, respectively, while at minimum friction (the EHL > ML transition) the reduction in friction is lower, but still about 6%, and as high as 9%. Secondly, the film thickness of the non-fully wetted contacts is reduced, which causes a shift in the minimum friction (the Stribeck curve) to higher v/F values. This suggests a lower bearing capacity for these contacts and the potential danger of a transition in the lubricationregime and, as a result, increased wear. However, we have derived several ""ready-to-use"" diagrams that are generally valid for any oil and surface properties and which allow us to define the film thickness, the lambdaparameter and the regime transition for different wetting/slip properties. These diagrams can be used directly to improve the prediction and design of the lubrication quality and the regimes of the macro-scale contacts by employing a currently used, conventional methodology and equations. Moreover, based on the experimental results and the ""ready-to-use"" diagrams derived in this investigation for non-fully wetted contacts, the slip at the solid-liquid interface, i.e., the DLC-PAO oil, was estimated independently from the data of two Stribeck curves to be about 20%.	che	Elsevier	2009	1.01	Wear	1.771	0.969

It was first extended to non-isothermal cases by introducing an equivalent temperature approach (ETA). The paper presents its extension, that is, the damage operator approach (DOA), enabling online continuous damage calculation for isothermal and non-isothermal loading with mean stress correction. The cycle closure point, cycle equivalent temperature, threshold temperature and separate rainflow counting, obligatory for the ETA, are not necessary for the DOA any more. Both approaches are equivalent for the second and subsequent runs of block loading if temperature is constant. However, for non-isothermal cases the DOA is within the worst- and the best-case scenarios of the ETA. Theapproaches are compared with the simple stress history and several thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) cycle types.	gbr	Blackwell Publishing	2009	1.01	Fatigue & fracture of engineering materials & structures	0.835	0.969

Our estimates for the southeastern countries support the hypothesis of an increase in stock exchange indices in the period of transition, due to the opening of the market economy followed by large capital inflows. The observed countries that are already in the EU wing (Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia) or those in the process of joining (Croatia and Montenegro) were found to be more dependent on the global financial markets and more exposed to adverse co-movements than other transitional southeastern countries (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia).	rou	Centre of Economic Computation and Economic cybernetic	2011	1.01	Economic Computation and Economic Cybernetics Studies and Research	0.303	1.032

1096305	Synthesis of new lipophilic phosphonate and phosphonamidate analogues of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine related to LK 423	A syntheses of three new muramyl dipeptide (MDP) analogues related to LK 423 as potential immunomodulators are presented. The dipeptide part of the lead compound was modified by introducing a phossphoneamide isostere instead of theamide bond between L-alanine and D-glutamic acid (or D-isoglutamine), yielding new MDP analogues 5 and 9. Furthermore, the amide bond between L-Ala and D-Glu was replaced by a phosphonate isistere, giving peptidyl phoshonate 14. The scope and limitations of the synthetic strategies employed are discussed.	deu	Springer;Molecular Diversity Preservation International	2002	1.01	Molecules	0.408	1.795
10963734	Improving the economic and environmental performances of the beet sugar industry in Slovenia: increasing fuel efficiency and using by-products for ethanol	This paper investigates the possibilities of attaining zero-waste emissions inthe case of sugar production. The case-studied sugar plant located in Slovenia reflected a typical plant, using traditional sugar production from beet. An investigation of the possible use of waste and by-products from sugarprocessing was carried out, in order to approach zero-waste from beet sugar processing. The sugar production process was simulated and optimization was carried out concerning energy utilization. Consumption of energy in the chosen sugar plant was lowered by simultaneous optimization of the evaporationand crystallization process. Changing the fuel type used in the case-studied sugar plant (replacement of heavy fuel oil with natural gas) produced a significant decrease in air emission. Opportunities in the sugar industry have been discovered for adapting to new market conditions through the optimization of combined sugar-ethanol production. The two proposed options have been economically and environmentally evaluated and compared.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Journal of cleaner production	1.073	1.376
10964508	How good are the growth and inflation forecasts for Slovenia?	This paper examines the quality of the macroeconomic forecasts of six institutions that regularly publish forecasts for Slovenia. The analysis focuses on an evaluation of the quality of forecasts for the real and nominal growth of GDP and for the average annual inflation rate for the period from 1997 to 2009. The quality of forecasts for selected macroeconomic variables was evaluated based on five groups of criteria: statistical measures of accuracy, comparison with the results of naive models, trace test, sign test and statistical tests of the unbiasedness and efficiency of forecasts. The results of the analysis do not provide an ""absolute winner"", but they do indicate the features of particular forecasts. It is also clear that the developers of models have until now most likely given priority to reducing forecasting errors, while neglecting the congruence in the direction of trend between the forecast and the actual result. The latter criterion in particularis very important for effective economic policy making.	rou	Expert	2011	1.01	Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting	0.246	1.032

10969878	Antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of rosemary extract in chicken frankfurters	The antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of commercially available oil-soluble rosemary extracts VivOX 20 and VivOX 4 were investigated against lipid oxidation and microbial growth in vacuum-packed chicken frankfurters. The content of the main active ingredient, carnosic acid, in extracts was 20% and 4% (w/w), respectively. For comparison, the activity of commercially available preservative Robin LI LS was also tested. The control was chicken frankfurters made without test additives. Antioxidant activity tests were performed at 3 storage temperatures (4, 12, 25 °C), using the Rancimat method.Antimicrobial effect was investigated by aerobic plate count. Results showed that both rosemary preparations possess antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that may make them useful in the food industry. In chicken frankfurters with added VivOX 20 and VivOX 4, higher oxidative stability was exhibited at all storage temperatures, as in frankfurters with Robin LI LS. Addition of VivOX 20, VivOX 4, and Robin LI LS also significantly reduced the aerobic plate count, compared to controls, stored at 4 or 12 °C.	usa	Institute of food technologists	2006	1.01	Journal of food science	1.004	1.025
1097065	Sensory electrical nerve stimulation for training dynamic balance responses in a chronic stroke patient	We propose a novel method for applying sensory electrical stimulation during perturbed stance in subjects with neurological impairment. The feasibility of this methodology was investigated in a case study with one chronic stroke patient. A dynamic standing frame was modified with electrical actuators which allow the application of unexpected perturbations to neurologically impaired people during standing, while protecting the subject from falling. The subject underwent two different periods of perturbation training, each lasting ten days. During the first period, the subject was perturbed in eight different directions. During the second period, the subject was also perturbed, but was assisted by sensory electrical stimulation of the soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), tensor fascia latae (TFL), and vastus muscles (VAS) in the impaired leg. After each period of training, an assessment was carried out to measure the forces the subject applied on the ground via two force plates and the EMG responses of the SOL, TA, TFL, and VAS muscles. The subject improved his ability to balance throughout the training, with the largest improvements occurring during the final period when sensory electrical stimulation was used. These observations verify the feasibility of the approach and suggest that sensory electrical stimulation may have a beneficial effect on balance training. Recommendations for further studies to verify the method in larger subject groups are given.	twn	Biomedical Engineering Society of ROC.	2011	1.01	Journal of medical and biological engineering	0.731	2.012
10970908	Charm-adjusted delta and delta gamma hedging	Hedging an option is easy in the basic Black-Scholes world. The only stochastic variable is the stock price, and by holding a short position in the stock equal to minus the partial derivative of the call price with respect to the stock, a momentarily riskless hedge of a call option is achieved. With no transactions costs or impediments to trading, the hedge can be rebalanced continuously through the entire life of the option. But delta hedging like this isn't possible in the real world, where it only makes sense to rebalance a hedge periodically, and the change in the delta as the stock price moves-theoption's gamma-becomes a source of unhedged risk. Delta-gamma hedges can manage both delta risk and the change in the delta, but volatility also changes over time, necessitating another Greek letter (or quasi-Greek in this case)-and vega was invented. As consideration extended to further higher-order derivatives, it put such a terrific strain on the Greek alphabet that an extension of the partial derivative naming convention was required. For example, ""charm"" is the derivative of delta with respect to time. And as this article shows, in an option hedge, charm becomes as important a risk factor as gamma close to maturity. The delta of an in-the-money (out-of-the-money) call converges rapidly to +1.0 (0.0) right at maturity, so a delta-hedged position can quickly become quite unhedged in the last few days. When charm is large, a more accurate hedge can be achieved using a modified hedge ratio, different from the standard delta.	usa	Institutional Investor, Inc.	2012	1.01	The Journal of derivatives	0.514	1.023
10971420	Beating the market in less developed financial exchange	The foundations of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) are being tested in this article. We propose that using public information (consensus target price), one can develop a s strategy that will outperform the benchmark. The average of the target prices is compared to the security's current price in order to calculate the target-to-real-price (TRP) ratio. As the ratio is observed to be stationary, we build upon the feature and propose various ways to implement it into the trading strategy. We create clear and simple-to-implement rules which indicate whether the stock is over/undervalued. We simulate the value of the protfolio based on the buy/sellsignals. Backtesting is used in order to compare the return of the model to the benchmark. Results of the trading strategy are positive, as the model outperforms the passive portfolio by more that 50 %. The strategy is implemented on the emerging market securities, but we note that stationarity of the ratio has already been observed in the developed market, which indicates consistency of the results.	ukr	Nacional´na akademiâ upravlinnâ	2012	1.01	Aktual´ni problemi ekonomiki	0.039	1.032
10975004	Activity-based management of logistic costs in a manufacturing company	Both the transparent reporting of logistics costs and the related accounting of their cost drivers present a significant factor for the successful management of material flows and the related logistics activities in production companies. These costs, which are mainly reported as part of overhead (indirect) costs in such companies, usually remain hidden or are not explicitly visible when the traditional method of accounting is applied. The aim of this research is to create a model of activity-based accounting of logistics costs in a production company, and to test its efficiency in the disclosure of logistics costs compared with traditional cost accounting. The application of the model in a production company shows that an activity based approach discloses as much as 108% more logistics costs at the level of a group of products than the traditional cost accounting approach. Further, detailed information on logistics costs obtained in this way enables their more efficient management.	hrv	Fakultet prometnih znanosti;Fakulteta za pomorstvo in promet;Universita degli studi di Trieste, Istituto per lo studio dei transporti nell'integrazione economica europea;Fakultet za saobraèaj i komunikacije;Fakulta prevadzky a ekonomiky dopravy a spojov;Dopravni fakulta Jana Pernera	2012	1.01	Promet	0.177	1.148

We constructed two types of credit scoring models: one based on standard logistic regression and the other on growing cell structures (GCS), something which has never before been applied to this area of research. The credit scoring task was performed on the pooled data set from a new member country of the European Union and its Economic and Monetary Union. The proposed model outperformed the benchmarking (logit) model. The results also demonstrate that the GCS model has better capability of capturing nonlinear relationships among variables and can better handle the properties of categorical variables.	usa	M. E.

10977814	The benchmarking of beet sugar plant - how to rate the environmental performance of a sugar plant against the sectors best	Despite many existing frameworks for the assessment of companies` sustainability, none of them specifically includes the benchmarking of beet sugar plants. This paper focusses on the performance assessment of traditional beet sugar plants, by considering the Best Available Techniques for beet sugar production, as determined by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive. The main objective was to establish a model for the self-evaluation of environmental and technological performances by sugar plants, benchmarked by the achievements expressed in the Reference Documents on Best Available Techniques for sugar production. The effectiveness of the model was tested in the performance assessment of the case studied sugar plant producing beet sugar and other sugar-related products. Based on the results of this case study, the model was recognized as a promising one for comparing the environmental and technological performances of the sugar plant with the leading sustainability-driven sugar plants.	gbr	International Sugar Journal	2006	1.01	International Sugar Journal	0.094	1.025

10980635	An instrument for measuring abrasive water jet diameter	In order to improve the accuracy of abrasive water jet (AW) machining the precise value of the jet diameter has to be known. Because of an aggressive environment caused by high velocity abrasive grains, the diameter is not easily measured. That is why a measuring device consisting of a load cell and a wear resistant probe was developed. The device measures the force of the jet while it passes over the edge of the probe. If the feed rate of the jet is constant and the time needed for jet to pass is known, the diameter can be determined. Because of probe wear issue several preliminary tests were made with water jet only in order to determine the measuring uncertainty and accuracy of the device. In the end the measurement of the AWJ was performed for two different focusing nozzles of different diameters.	usa	Pergamon	2009	1.01	International journal of machine tools & manufacture	1.956	0.969

The research operationalized entrepreneurs' characteristics according to psychological and non-psychological motivation factors; the former resulted in four types of Slovenian entrepreneurs while the latter was divided into human and social capital. Significant differences emerged among genders related to certain psychological motivation factors and social capital categories, but not human capital. Women remain an unexploited source of entrepreneurship; thus, Slovenia should establish effective mechanisms to promote female entrepreneurship.	deu	JEEMS;Rainer Hampp	2012	1.01	Journal for East European management studies	0.581	1.51

In this article we apply the method of field generators to a two-dimensional chaotic field record that describes the asynchronous motion of high-amplitude striations.

Owing to this, welded seams usually remain unprotected from corrosion and are accompanied by undesirable porosity. In this paper, the laser droplet generation process and its application to laser droplet welding of zinc coated steel sheets are described. The influences of laser droplet generation and welding process control parameters on the properties of joints of zinc coated steel sheets are presented. Results show that laser droplet welding offers a promising technology for spot and continuous welding of zinc coated steel sheets in different joint configurations with good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.	gbr	Institute of Materials	2009	1.01	Science and technology of welding and joining	1.327	0.699

The objective of this study was to investigate tourists' ecological expectations referring to the quality of spas and wellness hotel services in order to develop and test a scale for measuring the 'eco-component,' a new component of hotel service quality. The findings revealed four dimensions of the eco-component: hotel staff's eco-behaviour; environmentally friendly and healthy equipment; efficient use of energy and water; and bio-food. Tourists also demonstrated a hierarchy of eco-dimensions, with the most important being hotel staff's eco-behaviour and the least important being bio-food. Tourists' expectations about the level of eco-dimensions differ significantly with respect to their income, nationality, and the hotel certification. However, no significant difference emerged in their expectations due to different educational levels.	gbr	Pergamon Press	2012	1.01	International Journal of Hospitality Management	1.771	1.054

10996507	The use of noise and vibration signals for detecting cavitation in kinetic pumps	Cavitation in a kinetic pump reduces delivery head and efficiency of the pump.It also causes mechanical damage and an increase of vibrations and noise.Therefore, it is important to detect inception and development of a cavitation phenomenon in the pump. This article deals with signals of vibration and noise, which will be used for detection and monitoring of the cavitation in kinetic pumps, and also to prevent the effect of the cavitation in the pump and pumping system. When the cavitation is increasing, the flowing conditions are changing, which leads to an increase of vibrations of the pump and emitted noise in the surroundings. Because vibrations and noise are transferred from the pump through its casing, the signal is non-uniformly distorted due to transfer losses and structure of the casing surfaces. Noise and vibrations are increasing steadily, but in some specific frequency ranges the signal is more pronounced than in other parts of the spectrum. Experimental results have shown that vibration and noise in the audible spectrum can be successfully used for cavitation detection and its prevention.	gbr	Mechanical Engineering Publications	2009	1.01	Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers	0.416	0.969

In addition, the moisture absorption effect on the mechanical properties of the biocomposites was tested in this work. The results reveal that CL is a suitable modifier for both types of PVA. However, a more efficient enhancement of uniform shape and size distribution of CL particles within the PVA matrix was noticed in fully hydrolyzed matrix at low water contents. It is in agreement with glass transition temperature's observations. The samples conditioned at 50% of relative humidity (RH) showed decrease in E modulus and tensile strength in comparison with the material stored below 20% RH. Nevertheless, the enhancement of tensile properties, because of the modification with CL, was still noticeable especially for the partially hydrolyzed PVA-based biocomposites. The optimum concentration of themodifier was estimated on the basis of the obtained results.	usa	Society of Plastics Engineers	2009	1.01	Polymer composites	1.194	0.967

11002907	Computer-assisted engineering determination of the formability limit for thin sheet metals by a modified Marciniak method	Development of a new sheet-metal-forming technology in a digital environment demands accurate and reliable mechanical properties and forming limits of the selected material. It is essential to determine the forming limits for thin sheets and foils. Implementation of the Marciniak procedure with strip-shaped specimens defining the left-hand side of the forming limit diagram (FLD) results in tearing outside the observed area of the specimen. Therefore, new shapes of test pieces were designed with a strip-shaped central area and enlarged outer areas, which were in contact with the die during the forming process. The radius of the specimen enlargement enabled a co-axial contact of its edge and direction of the material flow over the die radius during the forming process. The shape of the redesigned geometry of the specimen was analysed using the finite element (FE) program ABAQUS to minimize undesired stress concentrations at the die radius. Finally, strain paths variations due to shape change were analysed. The new specimen concept was verified on TS-275 tinplate steel with a thickness of 0.24?mm. By implementing the necessary redesigned specimen shapes and by analysis of the tearing limit of the TS-275 material, the forming limit curve for the tinplate material under investigation was constructed.	gbr	Mechanical Engineering Publications	2009	1.01	Journal of strain analysis for engineering design	0.748	1.009

11009051	Numerical modelling of cavitation erosion	The goal of the work is to investigate the possibility of cavitation erosion prediction using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools only. For that purpose, a numerical process based on a coupling between CFD and an erosion model is presented and tested in several configurations of cavitating flow on a two-dimensional hydrofoil. The CFD code, which is based on the homogeneous approach, was previously validated on numerous experiments. In the present work, the predictions of velocity and pressure evolutions in the vicinity of the hydrofoil are compared with experimentally measured data. A close agreement is systematically obtained. The erosion model is based on the physical description of phenomena from cavitation cloud implosion, pressure wave emission and its attenuation, micro-jet formation and finally to the pit formation. The coupling between CFD and the erosion model is based on the use of local pressure, void fraction and velocity values to determine the magnitude of damage at a certain point. The results are compared with the experimentally measured damage on the hydrofoil. In the experiments a thin copper foil applied to the surface of the hydrofoil was used as an erosion sensor. A pit-count method was applied to evaluate the damage. The comparison shows that it is possible to use solely CFD tools to predict time evolution of cavitation erosion, including final extent and magnitude, with a very good accuracy.	gbr	Wiley	2009	1.01	International journal for numerical methods in fluids	0.936	1.201
11009307	Three-dimensional numerical simulation of the exhaust stroke of a single-cylinder four-stroke ICE	In this paper an extensive CFD simulation of the exhaust stroke of a single-cylinder fourstroke ICE, including the entire exhaust manifold is described. Guidelines for the implementation of the full threedimensional model of the discussed process are included. The simulation involves the time-dependent flow of exhaust gases through the exhaust valve and the flow dynamics within the 2.2-m-long, straight exhaust pipe during the period when the valve is closed. Also the intake port with the intake valve is being coupled during the valves' overlap period. The model geometry corresponds exactly to the actual engine geometry. The movement of the mesh follows the measured kinematics of the piston and the valves. The data obtained from the experimental environment was used for both the initialization and the validation of the computations. It was found that the phenomena affecting the dynamics of the exhaust flow are extremely three-dimensional and should be treated as such. In particular, the flow through the exhaust valve and the heat transfer along the exhaust pipe were influenced greatly by the effects of cold, fresh air breaking into the exhaust pipe in the period after the EVC. The presented study is the basis for future three-dimensional investigations of the entropy-generation rate along the exhaust system, including the exhaust valve.	deu	VDI-Verlag GmbH	2009	1.01	Forschung im Ingenieurwesen	0.391	0.918

11011868	Comovement dynamics between Central and Eastern European and developed European stock markets during European integration and amid financial crises -a wavelet analysis	Stock market comovements between developed (represented in the article by markets of Austria, France, Germany, and the UK) and developing stock markets (represented here by three Central and Eastern European (CEE) markets of Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) are of great importance for the financial decisions of international investors. From the point of view of portfolio diversification, short-term investors are more interested in the comovements of stock returns at higher frequencies (short-term movements), while long-term investors focus on lower frequencies comovements. As such, onehas to resort to a time-frequency domain analysis to obtain insight about comovements at the particular time-frequency (scale) level. The empirical literature on the CEE and developed stock markets interdependence predominantly apply simple (Pearsons) correlation analysis, Granger causality tests, cointegration analysis, and GARCH modeling. None of the existent empirical studies examine time-scale comovements between CEE and developed stock market returns. By applying a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform correlation estimator and a running correlation technique, we investigated the dynamics of stock market return comovements between individual Central and Eastern European countries and developed European stock markets in the period from 1997-2010. By analyzing the time-varying dynamics of stock market comovements on a scale-by-scale basis, we also examined how major events (financial crises in the investigated time period and entrance to the European Union) affected the comovement of CEE stock markets with developed European stock markets. The results of the unconditional correlation analysis show that the developed European stock markets of France, the UK, Germany and Austria were more interdependent in the observed period than the CEEs stock markets. The later group of countries exhibited a lower degree of comovement between themselves as well as with the developed European stock markets during all the observed time period. The Slovenian stock market was the least correlated with other stock markets. By using the rolling wavelet correlation technique, we wanted to answer the question as to how the correlation between CEE and developed stock markets changed over the observed period. In particular, we wanted to examine whether major economic (financial) and political events in the world and European economies (the Russian financial crisis, the dot-com financial crisis, the attack on the WTC, the CEE countries joining the European union, and the recent global financial crisis) have influenced the dynamics of CEE stock market comovements with developed European stock markets. The results show that stock market return comovements between CEE and developed European stock markets varied over time scales and time. At all scales and during the entire observed time period the Hungarian and Czech stock markets were more interconnected to developed European stock markets than the Slovenian stock market was. The highest comovement between the investigated CEE and developed European stock market returns was normally observed at the highest scales (scale 5, corresponding to stock market return dynamics over 32-64 days, and scale 6, corresponding to stock market return dynamics over 32-64 and 64-128 days). At all scales the Hungarian and Czech stock markets were more connected to developed European stock markets than the Slovenian stock market. We found that European integration lead to increased comovement between CEE and developed stock markets, while the financial crises in the observed periodled only to short-term increases in stock market return comovements.	ltu	Technologija.	2012	1.01	Ininerin¹e ekonomika	1.468	1.032
11012124	Comovement between Central and Eastern European and Developed European Stock Markets	Stock market comovements between stock markets is of great importance for the financial decisions of international investors. By applying a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform correlation estimator, we investigated the level and dynamics of stock market return comovements between three Central and Eastern European stock markets (Slovenian, Hungarian and the Czech) and four developed European stock market (Austria, France, Germany and the United Kingdom). We found that stock market return comovements between CEE and developed European stock markets vary over time scales and time. The highest comovement between the stock market returns is normally achieved at the highest scales (scales 5 and 6). At all scales, Hungarian and the Czech stock market are more connected to developed European stock markets than Slovenian stock market.	ukr	Nacional´na akademiâ upravlinnâ	2012	1.01	Aktual´ni problemi ekonomiki	0.039	1.032
11020827	Quantification of flow kinematics using computer-aided visualization	The paper presents a study of the ability of the visualization methods to measure velocity field in the fluid flow from the concentration field of a passive tracer that is introduced to the fluid. The method is based on the advection diffusion equation. A sequence of successive flow images was processed to obtain the required unknown terms. Concentration of the passive tracer was acquired through greyscale intensity on images at chosen measurement points. Standard numerical procedures were applied to obtain spatial- and time derivatives of the passive tracer concentration. The method was tested in an experiment with an air jet flowing out of a pipe, where the velocity field in a jet was measured with a hotwire anemometer. Comparison of the results of both methods shows good agreement, albeit with certain deviations that are a consequence of simplified approach of the visualization method. The results prove the suitability of the visualization method for quantitative measurements of flow kinematics. Further studies and improvement sof the method could provide a simple and relatively cheap yet reliable tool not only for preliminary assessment of the flow velocity field, but also for velocity measurements in complex flow structures.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969

Kepler's Conjecture and the Dodecahedral Conjecture are of a great importance in circle searching, specially in the Poincaré dodecahedron space as a cosmological model. Some properties of the 120-cell Coxeter polytop are presented. E-infinity Cantorian space-time may be regarded as a fuzzy version of a hyperbolic manifold based on the 120-cell Coxeter polytop. The topology of fuzzy 4-dimensional polytops are used to give information about the number of the elementary particles in the standard model of high energy physics.	nld	Pergamon	2007	1.01	Chaos, solitons and fractals	3.025	0.979
11021083	Sound emitted at boundary layer during steel quenching	Quenching and tempering often represents the final stage in the manufacturing process of machine parts. The choice of optimum parameters of a quenching process and monitoring of the process itself ensures the achievement of the specified hardness and residual stress in the surface layer of the machine component. A hardening process can be controlled by selecting different quenching parameters (quenching media, its temperature, specimen temperature, .). In order to control the hardening process, one should be able to monitor the quenching process in real time. This paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of sound emission and some of the results obtained during the quenching process. Due to the heat transfer from the specimen to the quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur around the heated object, which strongly affects quenching. Bubble formation, their development and implosions, and disappearing around the surface causes sound emission whose intensity depends on the intensity of the bubbles' oscillation and the speed of their disappearing, i.e. on the quenching process. Sound-pressure signals demonstrated by different amplitudes depending on time, at different frequencies, are shown in 3D diagrams. It was established that an analysis of sound emission signals can provide useful information that confirms the differences occurring in quenching with different quenching media and under different quenching conditions. Analyses of sound emission demonstrated that sound emission during quenching process can be used for monitoring the hardening process. Analysis of the quenching results and sound emission signals during the process itself confirm the applicability of the new approach to the controlling of steel quenching.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969

When the dye strength errors were not involved, the biggest scattering of the recipe colour in repeated dyeings was observed in the cases of light neutral target colours, where the predicted sensitivity to random concentration errors was the highest. For a few low-saturated targets, eight recipes with different predicted sensitivities to random errors were treated. In six cases out of the seven treated, those recipes less sensitive to random concentration errors generally performed better than the more sensitive ones, but the correlation was rather weak. For those cases whenthe dye strength errors were included, experiments were also carried out with several different recipes for a neutral medium-lightness target colour.	gbr	Blackwell	2007	1.01	Coloration technology	0.650	0.674
11025430	Functional properties of wires and thin ribbons of several shape memory alloys	NiTi, NiTiW and CuAlNi samples with variations of the microstructure in each alloy have been trained in order to induce two-way effects which would be interesting for technical applications. The effects immediately after training are the higher the lower the strength of specimen is. Therefore, the highest values of ?$s_2w$? (about 3%) have been achieved in annealed NiTi samples. Most possible technical applications, however, would need long-term stability of the TWSME. In this case we get an opposite influnce of the microstuctural features and the strength of the material: softer material can be trained easily to higher effect size, but the stability is weak. On the other hand, samples of higher strength are harder to train, exibit smaller TWSME values, but prove to be relatively stable against functional fatigue (NiTiW and CuAlNi alloys). In addition, thin ribbons from CuAlNi were produced successfully by melt spinning. Al ribbons exhibited a shape memory effect immediately after melt-spinning. The microstructure at room temperature is martensitic, but the grains are unexpectedly coarse, therefore only very low ductility was achieved. Subsequent cold-rolling improved the mechanical properties, but not to an extent as would be required of shape memory componets. Adding boron to the alloy allowed to produce a finer microstructure while obtaining more ductile ribbons. The training of thin ribbons, investigation and optimization of size and stability of the two-way effect will be performed in the near future.	usa	Wiley-VCH	2006	1.01	Advanced engineering materials	1.402	1.659
11027227	Surface texturing by pulsed Nd:YAG laser	Introducing specific textures on a tribological surface can contribute to friction reduction in sliding contacts. In the present paper, a pulsed Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm, was used against 100Cr6 steel samples in order to produce well-defined surface micro-pores, which can act as lubricant reservoirs, micro-hydrodynamic bearings as well as traps for wear debris. Due to the high flexibility of the laser system, structural features such as shape, size, density and depth can be varied easily by changing the laser parameters. To optimize the parameters of the laser surface texturing process, an investigation was performed using different pulse numbers, various pulse energies and two different modes (single- and multi-mode). The microtextures were characterized with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by topography techniques. The relationship between the laser processing parameters and qualitative and quantitative profile of the micro-pores was studied. Tribological testing of laser textured surfaces was performed in a low frequency-long displacement reciprocating sliding wear tester under boundary lubrication and results compared to un-textured case. Tribological comparison of textured, textured and lapped, and untextured surfaces shows only minimal influence of texturing for contact conditions investigated.	gbr	Elsevier	2009	1.01	Tribology international	1.690	0.969

The method enables the determination of the length of objects in digital images from their detected contour. The algorithm is based on discrete convolution by using different convolution masks and points anchored within the pixels. The anchoring prevents the point shifting in the pixel during the calculation and contributes to smoothing capabilities of the algorithm on the measured data. In this paper a Gaussian convolution mask is used on the experimental curves to evaluate the presented algorithm as a measuring tool.	gbr	Elsevier	2009	1.01	Measurement	0.761	0.918

The measured phase-shift error perfectly agress with the theoretically determined phase-shift error region. This error is systematic, periodic and severely asymmetrical around the nominal displacement value.

11036950	MINLP synthesis of reactor networks in overall process schemes based on a concept of time-dependent economic regions	The design and optimization of reactor networks using the conventional conceptof attainable region is based on technological (conversion, selectivity, etc.), rather than, economical criteria (cost, profit, etc.). The solution from the economical point of view when the operating and investment costs cannot be neglected may not be optimal, not even in regard to the structure. In order to circumvent this deficiency, the conventional Concentration Attainable Region (CAR) is transformed into an Economic Region (ER) using economic optimization criteria. A novel concept for ER constructionis proposed for multi-D problems. One-parametric NLP or MINLP optimizations with reactor volume as a varying parameter are performed to construct trajectories in the ER. In this way the ER is aided by mathematical programming for 3D or more D problems in order to handle dimensions higher than 2 as degrees of freedom for the economic objective function. ER is attainable (EAR) only when the economic objective function is linear. The more the objective function is discontinuous, discrete, nonlinear and non-convex and the more its cost coefficients vary with time, the less the principles of AR can be applied to ER. However, economically optimal reactor systems always lie at the borders of ERs. Two important insights have been gained during the construction of different time-dependent ERs, which have been used in upgrading the MINLP approach to the synthesis of reactor networks in overall process schemes: (i) A reactor network superstructure has been reestablished based on economical optimization criteria and the principles of ER. (ii) Over a longer period, the performing of a stochastic multi-period MINLP synthesis is recommended, in order to consider the time variability and uncertainties of economic parameters. A special multi-period strategy is proposed to upgrade the efficiency of the MINLP synthesis.	gbr	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	Computers & Chemical Engineering	1.238	1.015

11043355	Uniform power transmission gears	A new type of lubricated gears is presented in this paper, referred to as Uniform Power Transmission Gears (UPTG), which have conformal shaped teeth flanks that enable a more uniform transmission of power and motion. The proposed teeth flanks comprise three arcs: an addendum arc, a dedendum arc, with both of these joined by a connecting arc. These UPT gears have been derived from Hawkinsæ patented Zero Sliding Gears (YSG) [4]. The name Uniform Power Transmission Gears derives from the fact that these gears operate during power transmission with an almost constant value of friction and a nearly constant value of power transmission. Thus, the power transmission of the UPT gears occurs simultaneously with the doublecontact teeth flanks of the driving and driven gears, which means the transmitted power is divided into two parts: the contact pressure in the contacts is lower, and the gear pair conjugates as helical gears. UPT gears can be produced on common gear cutting machines based on a rolling process where teeth shapes are formed by successive enveloping cuts of a cutter. However, the cutter teeth should be manufactured by the UPT rack profile. A comparison of the UPTGs with involute-type gears is presented. The radii of curvature are investigated in detail and the velocities in the teeth flank contacts were analyzed. Additionally, an investigation of oil-film thickness using the theory of Hamrock and Dowson is discussed. Owing to the decisive influence of heat caused by friction on gearsæ scuffing resistance, and the heating of the teeth flanks based on Blokæs flash-temperature criterion, we have made a careful study and the results are presented. Because the power transmission with UPTGs occurs mostly by rolling, with only a minor amount by sliding, such gears are verz suitable for heavy-duty power transmission at relatively slow speed working conditions.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969
11043606	The effect of adsorbed carboxymethyl cellulose on the cotton fibre adsorption capacity for surfactant	The research reported in this paper demonstrates that the capacity of cotton fibres to adsorb cationic surfactants as well as the rate of the adsorption process can be increased by adsorbing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) onto the fibre surfaces. In addition, the adsorption can be restricted to the fibre surface. CMC was deposited by means of adsorption from an aqueous solution. The adsorption of N-cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) from an aqueous solution onto the CMC-modified fibres was measured using UV-spectrometric determination of the surfactant concentration in the solution. Adsorption onto the cotton fibres was studied in a weakly basic environment (pH 8.5) where cotton fibres are negatively charged and the CPC ion is positively charged. Modification of the fibres by adsorption of CMC introduces new carboxyl groupsonto the fibre surfaces, thereby increasing the adsorption capacity of the fibres for CPC. The initial rate of adsorption of CPC increased proportionally with the amount of chargeè however, this rate slowed down at high degrees of coverage on fibres with a high charge. The adsorption of cationic surfactant to the anionic surface groups was stoichiometric, with no indication of multilayer or admicelle formation. It was evident that the acidic group content of the fibres was the primary factor determining cationic surfactant adsorption to these fibres.	nld	Chapman & Hall;Kluwer Academic Publishers	2006	1.01	Cellulose	1.539	0.513

It takes into account damage occurrence and accumulation in the material and its relation to isotropic and kinematic hardening or softening. The material constitutive model for description of low-cycle fatigue behaviour is highly non-linear and therefore its parameter identification requires complex numerical procedure, such as genetic algorithm (GA). Because of its complexity, the unique genetic operatorsæ routines in GA calculation procedure are developed to make possible fast and reliable convergence to the results. These routines are incorporated in developed software solution.

11049238	Influence of magnetic field on the aragonite precipitation	Many laboratory investigations of magnetic water treatment (MWT) for scale control explained the formation of less compact scales by raised portion of aragonite, which is needle-like and less adhesive than rhombohedral calcite crystals, while our experiment was conducted with tap water, which contains Mg+2 and Fe+2 ions in concentrations exceeding thresholds for calcite inhibition, common for major tap waters. MWT efficiency was evaluated by amounts of scale precipitated in boilers and pipes during three-weeks run of two parallel experimental lines-one with and another without magnetic treatment. All scales were identified by X-ray diffractometer to be aragonite,but in the case of magnetic treatment, scales occurred in much smaller amounts: the scale on heating copper-pipe spiral was 2.5-times thinnerdue to MWT and in zinc-coated steel pipe occurred as very thin powder-like coating, while in the line without the treatment abundant hard lining was formed. The scalesæ morphology was observed by scanning electron microscope: the husks from both lines consisted of parallel distributed needles, but these crystals were about four times thinner in the case of MWT. The present work demonstrates that hard scale deposits can form even under conditions where aragonite precipitates predominantly, and that MWT can also affect the crystallization of this polymorph in a manner conducive to scaling control.	nld	Pergamon Press	2007	1.01	Chemical Engineering Science	1.775	1.015

An approximation of the wavelet transform of the impulse response function is deduced, which serves as a basis for the extraction of the natural frequencies, the damping ratios and the mode shapes. Due to an approximation with a finite Taylor series, a computational error in the identified oscillatory amplitude occurs and is observed for the simulated system response. The presented approach of modal identification is applied to real mechanical systems, such as a steel beam and the horizontal tail of an ultralight aircraft. Using the proposed measurement methodology, it is possible to reconstruct the spatial mode shapes of any dynamic linear system with an arbitrary geometry.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969

However, ozonization is a slow process and is not efficient in the removal of atrazine from drinking water. Better results were achieved at alkaline pH. The aim of our work was to degrade atrazine by ozonization of drinking water using Pt-catalyst and to compare the results with other ozonization processes. Up to 93% of atrazine removal was achieved by applying Pt-catalyst, especially in pH range around 7. The concentrations of some metabolites were observed during the ozonization.

The major sources of uncertainty regarding the measurement results were identified as contributions to linear least-square or weighted regression lines, precision, trueness, storage conditions, and sampling. Determination of anions in wastewater is very important for the purification procedure, especially the amount of nitrate in waste and potable waters. The determined expanded uncertainty was 6% for nitrate anions and 8.3% for sulphate anions.

The target application is designed to grab an image from a camera, Gode the image using a wavelet-based Godec, and send a coded file over a wireless global system for mobile communications/ general packet radio services (GSM/GPRS) network. Since the channel capacity of the GSM/GPRS network is limited, a OSP with a relatively low computational power is sufficient to implement an image codec.

They are applied mostly for thin single metal sheets. However, such technologies could also be interesting to form individual multi-layer construction elements. As such construction elements consists of metal plates that are usually hot zinced and painted before forming process, it is necessary to select an appropriate technology with stable process parameters to avoid any damages. In this article, particularities of an incremental forming application as additional technology in multi-layer construction element production are presented. Special attention is dedicated to the forming principles, the forming influences on the mechanical properties of the multi layer element and the corrosion of the locally deformed coloured metal plate. The latter two activities represent the most important requirements in order to fulfil construction standards and due dates, both independently of unpredictable sharp weather conditions.

The EEG of low intelligent individuals showed a reverse pattern of cortical activity. In the auditive oddball task the decrease in the activated cortical volume in high intelligent individuals was accompanied by an increase in current density, and a more left hemispheric source location at maximum current density. The results suggest that high intelligent individuals more efficiently distributed their cognitive resources needed to cope with the oddball tasks	nld	Elsevier Science publishers	2001	1.01	Brain research.

11060246	Ecological alternatives to the reduction and oxidation processes in dyeing with vat and sulphur dyes	This article gives a summary of the most commonly used ecologically unfriendly processes for the reduction and oxidation of vat and sulphur dyes. It also describes the new alternatives that are in the development stage and could be important in the near future. Sodium dithionite as the dominant reducing agent produces large amounts of sodium sulphate, and also toxic sulphite and thiosulphate as by-products. Consequently, high amounts of hydrogen peroxide and alkali are required for the treatment of effluents, which add to the cost of the process. Attempts have been made to use organic biodegradable reducing agents, enzymes, catalytic hydrogenation, and also indirect or direct, electrochemical reductive methods that employ a redox mediator (electron-carrier). The reduction has also been carried out via the dye radical molecule or, in the case of indigo, by direct electrochemical reduction using graphite as the electrode material. Physical techniques, for example using ultrasound, magnetic fields or UV have been shown to be effective only when used to accelerate methods using classical reduction and oxidation processes. However, although these methods offer some environmental benefits, there is still no satisfactory alternative reducing and/or oxidising agent available today.	nld	Elsevier	2008	1.02	Dyes and pigments	2.507	0.672

11062038	The removal of reactive dye printing compounds using nanofiltration	A synthetically prepared reactive dye print wastewater, mimicking real wastewater obtained from a local textile mill, was treated by nanofiltration using an NFT-50 membrane in a plate and frame module configuration at different cross-flow velocities (0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 m/s) and pressures (2-15 bar). The nanofiltration membrane was evaluated for membrane fouling, permeate flux and its suitability for removing colour, conductivity, Na+ ions and COD as a function of operating pressure and feed concentration. The permeate separation efficiency was monitored by measuring the removal efficiency of colour, conductivity, Na+ ions and COD retention. The membrane achieved high dye retention for each of the four dyes (from 99.4 to 99.9%) and electrolytes used (63-73%). The retention of organic substances varied between 20 and 50%, depending on the pressure used; higher retentions were achieved at higher pressure and by using higher cross-flow velocities.	gbr	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Dyes and pigments	2.796	0.674
11063574	The maximum number of elementary particles in a super symmetric extension of the standard model	In a series of papers over the last few years El Naschie addressed the question of the minimum and maximum number of elementary particles which a mathematically consistent and a physically meaning full extended standard model should contain. El Naschie's minimum is 62 particles namely 60 believed to have been already discovered in addition to one Higgs boson and one graviton which are theoretically needed but are not jet experimentally conformed. By contrast the maximum number of 69 particles is although consistent with many quantum field theories based models as well as a classical result by Dyson may not be the only possibility. In the present work we show that a larger number of 72 or even 84 particles are easily shown to be consistent with super string theory and super symmetry. Our work consists of two parts. The first part is a reappraisal of El Naschie's results and the second is a derivation of the proposed possibility of an upper bound of 72 or 84 elementary particles.	nld	Pergamon	2007	1.01	Chaos, solitons and fractals	3.025	0.979
11064091	A company's readiness for concurrent product and process development	When entering the global market, companies encounter several difficulties, the most severe being long product development times, which are unacceptable for customers. In order to overcome this problem, companies will have to make a shift from sequential to concurrent product development as soon as possible. This paper presents strategic management in product development: parallelness, standardisation and integration of product development processes. Furthermore, the changes required by a transition from sequential to concurrent product development are presented with respect to the organisation of processes ,the organisation of work (team-work), IT and preparation of product documentation. The paper concludes with a case study: analysis regarding readiness for a transition to concurrent product development (capability and motivation for team-work, susceptibility to team-work dysfunctions) in a company which is a development supplier of components for automotive industry and a proposal of activities that will have to be carried out in the company before the transition to the concurrent product development is done.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969
11064347	Automatic detection of spring faults during assembly of reciprocating compressors	Automatic condition monitoring application for the detection of spring faults during assembling of reciprocating compressors is presented in this paper. Spring faults are characterized by incorrect positioning of compressor body on the supporting springs. Consequently, compressors with such faults should be detected and eliminated from the production. The paper describes development and application of a condition monitoring (CM) system for the production line. The CM system is composed of a mechanical pneumatic system and a software for the analysis and detection of failures. The mechanical system is designed to push toward the body of the compressor and simultaneously measure the pressing force. Spring faults are characterized by an increased force, therefore force signals are used to extract features, appropriate for an automatic condition monitoring. The system was tested during regular production in the company, with additional sets of compressors with built-in spring faults. The main contribution of this paper is the development and testing of various decision strategies for the recognition of faulty compressors. Standard 3-sigma decision strategy is compared to optimized stationary decision strategy and two adaptive strategies: adaptive strategy with constant deviation and adaptive strategy with adaptive deviation. Results show that adaptive decision strategy with adaptive deviation yields the best fault recognition rate and is, therefore recommended for the application on the industrial production line.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969
11066139	A novel pelton turbine model for water hammer analysis	This paper presents a novel Pelton turbine model for water hammer analysis. Water hammer phenomena have been investigated in Peruæica high-head hydropower plant (HPP), Montenegro. During its first phase of modernisation and refurbishment new distributors (needle valves) have been installed on the first two Pelton turbine units. Closure of the Pelton turbine distributors for the case of emergency shut-down and load rejection under governor control is modelled by two different closing laws i.e. the two-speed closing law and the law that considers actual (measured) needle stroke. Dissipation torques in turbine housing and shaft bearings are considered in the model. Stop procedure of the turbine unit is also investigated. Numerical results using the standard quasi-steady friction model and the convolution based unsteady friction model for different distributor closing laws are compared with the results of measurements. The agreement between computed and measured results is reasonable. It is shown that the effect of unsteady friction on water hammer events in Peruæica HPP is of little importance (slow varying transients).	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969

11067163	Availability management of complex technical systems	This work presents basic elements of availability management methodology in complex technical systems according to the business and user perspectives. The methodology primarily relates to Information Technology (IT) systems, and the presented availability perspectives are based on parameters resulted from the exploitation conditions, according to analysis of the Tax Administration Information System of the Republic of Serbia - DIS 2003. The result of the implemented technology enhances the availability level through the clear identification and elimination of critical elements that affect the stability of IT infrastructure and ensures a continuing service provided bz the system. The criteria of the optimization applied within the implementation of the availability enhancing process present a relation between the cost price of service provided by the system and expenditures of investments in improvements. Considering the established business requirements through the system, the availability management process should be given an appropriate level of service.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969
11067414	Assessment of the load-bearing capacity of a primary pipeline	High-alloyed Cr-Ni-based two-phase stainless steel (SS) cast alloys are commonly used in nuclear power plants. The mechanical equipment in these facilities can contribute to a reduction in its resistance to stable crack growth as a result of extended operating times and high temperatures. The toughness of these materials strongly depends on their delta (?$/delta$?) ferrite content, which spinodally decomposes into two phases with different ratios of Cr and Ni at a relatively low (slightly above 300 °C) temperature. This temperature is similar to the operating temperature of the vital parts, for example, the coolant system. The formation of two phases with the same crystalstructure but different lattice parameters causes internal elastic stresses that result in a hardness increase and an impact-toughness decrease. The result is an increased risk of crack formation in the stress-concentration zones such as the critical regions of different welded joints (e.g. ""L, T, K and X"" shapes). The values of the critical stress intensity factor change according to its position along the crack contour. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the influence of the materials' changes on the crack extension and the decrease of the primary pipeline's bearing capacity by taking account of the increased temperature and time of operation for the given loading conditions. The SINTAP (European Structural Integrity Assessment Procedure) was used for this assessment.	usa	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	Engineering fracture mechanics	1.227	1.049
11072278	A novel metalloprotease from Bacillus cereus for protein fibre processing	A novel protease produced by Bacillus cereus grown on wool as carbon and nitrogen source was purified. B. cereus protease is a neutral metalloprotease with a molecular mass of 45.6 kDa. The optimum activity was at 45 °C and pH 7.0. The substrate specificity was assessed using oxidized insulin B-chain and synthetic peptide substrates. The cleavage of the insulin B-chain was determined to be Asn3, Leu6, His10-Leu11, Ala14, Glu21, after 12 h incubation. Among the peptide substrates, the enzyme did not exhibit activity towards ester substrates; with p-nitroanilide, the kinetic data indicate that aliphatic and aromatic amino acids were the preferred residues at the P1 position. For furylacryloyl peptides substrates, which are typical substrates for thermolysin, the enzyme exhibited high hydrolytic activity with a Km values of 0.858 and 2.363 mM for N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Phe amide and N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide, respectively.

11072534	The influence of enzymatic treatment on wool fibre properties using PEG-modified proteases	The main contribution of the presented work was to introduce the use of proteases modified with the soluble polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the bio-finishing process of wool fibres, to target enzyme action to the outerparts of wool fibres, i.e. to avoid the diffusion and consequent destroying of the inner parts of the wool fibre structure, in the case of native proteases using. Different proteolytic enzymes from Bacillus lentus and Bacillus subtilis in native and PEG-modified forms were investigated and their influence on the modification of wool fibres morphology surface, chemical structure, as well as the hydrolysis of wool proteins, the physico-mechanical properties, and the sorption properties of 1:2 metal complex dye during dyeing were studied. SEM images of wool fibres confirmed smoother and cleaner fibre surfaces without fibre damages using PEG-modified proteases. Modified enzyme products have a benefit effect on the wool fibres felting behaviours (14%) in the case when PEG-modified B. lentus is used, without markedly fibre damage expressed by tensile strength and weight loss ofthe fibre. Meanwhile the dye exhaustion showed slower but comparable level of dye uptake at the end of the dyeing.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Ltd	2007	1.01	Enzyme and microbial technology	1.969	2.575

Laccase and Mn-peroxidase were purified from the culture liquid using gel permeation and ion-exchange chromatographies. Purified Mn-peroxidase performed decolorization of all textile dyes tested (Reactive Black 5, Reactive Blue 19, Reactive Red 22 and Reactive Yellow 15). Laccase was inactive with Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Red 22, while all dyes were decolorized after addition of the redox mediators violuric acid (VA) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). The culture liquid from I. resinosum cultures was also able to decolorize all dyes as well as the synthetic dyebaths in the presence of VA and HBT. The highest decolorization rates were detected in acidic pH (3-4).	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Ltd	2007	1.01	Enzyme and microbial technology	1.969	2.575

11091289	Heat sources and electronic refrigerators	Tunneling electric current through the normal metal-insulator-superconductor junction is accompanied with heat flow out of normal metal when properly voltage biased. The phenomenon enables cooling of electrons and phonons (under specific conditions) in the region below 1 K. At lower bath temperatures two parasitic heat sources decrease refrigerator performance. (i) Due to tunneling of hot electrons from a normal metal electrode to a superconductive one an excess quasiparticle density appears in the superconductor which results in tunneling of electrons back to the normal metal and consequently the normal metal electron temperature increases. This phenomenom is called back tunneling. (ii) Second heat source is is the Cooper pair formation: the part of energy released by the formation of Cooper pairs in a superconductor is dissipated in a normal metal. Both contribution are calculated by considering quasiparticle behavior in the junction region and no free parameters are introduced. Diffusion, tunneling and back tunneling of quasiparticles in the superconductor in equilibrium are considered to calculate temperatures of electrons and phonons in the normal metal electrode. This detailed model explains the increase of normal metal electron temperatures above the bath temperature at lower bath temperatures.	usa	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2001	1.01	IEEE transactions on applied superconductivity	1.278	0.724

11092763	Extension of the Bissell-Johnson plasma-sheath model for application to fusion-relevant and general plasmas	This article presents an approach to solving a special Fredholm-type integral equation of the first kind with a particular kernel containing a modified Bessel function for applications in plasma physics. From the physical point of view, the problem was defined by Bissell and Johnson (B&J) [Phys. Fluids 30,779 (1987)] as a task to find the potential profile and the ion velocity distribution function in a plane-parallel discharge with a Maxwellian ion source. The B&J model is a generalization of the well-known Tonks-Langmuir (T&L) [Phys. Rev. 34, 876 (1929)] discharge model characterized by a ""cold"" ion source. Unlike the T&L model, which can be readily solved analytically, attempts to solve the B&J model with a ""warm"" ion source have been done only numerically. However, the validity of numerical solutions up to date remains constrained to a rather limited range of a crucial independent parameter of the B&J integral equation, which mathematically is the width of a Gaussian distribution and phzsically represents the ion temperature. It was solved only for moderately warm ion sources. This paper presents the exact numerical solution of the B&J model, which is valid without any restriction regarding the above-mentioned parameter. It is shown that the ion temperature is very different from the temperature of the ion source. The new results with high-temperature ion sources are not only of particular importance for understanding and describing the plasma-sheath boundary in fusion plasmas, but are of considerable interest for discharge problems in general. The eigenvalue of the problem, found analytically by Harrison and Thompson [Proc. Phys. Soc. 74, 145 (1959)] for the particular case of a cold ion source, is here extended to arbitrary ion-source temperatures.	usa	American Institute of Physics	2009	1.01	Physics of plasmas	2.475	1.922
11099670	Pressure drop characteristics of poly(high internal phase emulsion) monoliths	Today, monoliths are well-accepted chromatographic stationary phases due to several advantageous properties in comparison with conventional chromatographic supports. A number of different types of monoliths have already been described, among them recently a poly(high internal phase emulsion) (PolyHIPE) type of chromatographic monoliths. Due to their particular structure, we investigated the possibility of implementing different mathematical models to predict pressure drop on PolyHIPE monoliths. It was found that the experimental results of pressure drop on PolyHIPE monoliths can best be described by employing the representative unit cell (RUC) model, which was originally derived for the prediction of pressure drop on catalytic foams. Models intended for the description of particulate beds and silica monoliths were not as accurate. The results of this study indicate that the PolyHIPE structure under given experimental condition is, from a hydrodynamic point of view, to some extent similar to foam structures, though any extrapolation of these results may not provide useful predictions of pressure versus flow relations and further experiments are required.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Journal of chromatography	3.641	1.847
11100699	Energy conversion efficiency of hybrid electric heavy-duty vehicles operating according to diverse drive cycles	Energy consumption and exhaust emissions of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) strongly depend on the HEV topology, power ratios of their components and applied control strategy. Combined analytical and simulation approach was applied to analyze energy conversion efficiency of different HEV topologies. Analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations and considers allenergy paths in the HEVs from the energy sources to the wheels and to other energy sinks. Simulation approach is based on a fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series HEVs as well as for conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, and considers all components relevant for modeling energy conversion phenomena. Combined approachenables evaluation of energy losses on different energy paths and provides their impact on the fuel economy. It therefore enables identification of most suitable HEV topology and of most suitable power ratios of the components for targeted vehicle application, since it reveals and quantifies the mechanisms that could lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of particular HEV. The paper exposes characteristics of the test cycles that lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of HEVs. Mechanisms leading to improved fuel economy of parallel HEVs through drive-away and vehicle propulsion at low powertrain loads by electric motor are also analyzed. It was also shown that control strategies managing energy flow through electric storage devices significantly influence energy conversion efficiency of series HEVs.	gbr	Pergamon	2009	1.01	Energy Conversion and Management	1.944	1.269
11105563	AE signals as laser cutting quality indicators	The paper presents results of an analysis of acoustic emission (AE) signals obtained during laser cutting of a steel plate, which is frequently used in the production of automotive body components. The acoustic emission in the plate, which is produced by various physical phenomena occurring during the laser cutting process, was measured with contact PYT sensors. During the laser cutting process, continuous AE signals, which are produced by the action of a cutting gas, were captured. After laser cutting, AE bursts produced by various phenomena during material cooling were captured. The results obtained confirm that both the continuous signals occurring during the cutting process and the AE bursts after laser cutting provide a good insight into the quality of a laser cut performed. Results of a factorial analysis of an influence of laser cutting conditions on the measured continuous AE signals are described. Response surfaces of amplitude average and intensity average and their mutual correlation are established. An influence of cutting parameters on the size of a dross formed at the lower laser-cut edge, which is an important indicator of cut quality, is analysed and a relation with the measured AE signals is established.	gbr	British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing	2009	1.01	Insight	0.434	1.009
1110664	Lack of Socs2 expression causes the high-growth phenotype in mice	Characterizing causal molecular defects in mouse models of over growth or dwarfism helps to identify the key genes and pathways that regulate the growth process. We report here the molecular basis for high growth (hg), a spontaneous mutation that causes a 30-50% increase in postnatal growth. We conclude that hg is an allele of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (Socs2), a member of a family of regulators of cytokine signal transduction. We demonstrate mapping of Socs2 to the hg region, lack of Socs2 mRNA expression, a disruption of the Socs2 locus in highgrowth (HG) mice, and a similarity of pheotypes of HG mice and Socs2 mice generated by gene targeting. Characteristics of the HG phenotype suggest that Socs2 deficiency affects growth prenatally and postnatally most likely through deregulating the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor I(IGF1). These results demonstrate a critical role for Socs2 in controlling growth.	usa	Academic Press	2001	1.01	Genomics	3.418	1.706

The models enable simultaneously to consider the influence of inserted CFRP strips, flexibility of mechanical fasteners in the connecting areas and any appearing of tensile cracks in the coating boards.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Ltd	2008	1.01	Applied mathematical modelling	0.931	1.044

Additionally, the L->S phase transformation was monitored and compared with conventional differential thermoanalysis.

11119131	Modification of axial fan flow by trailing edge self-induced blowing	Axial fans often show adverse flow conditions at the fan hub and at the tip of the blade. The modification of conventional axial fan blade is presented. Hollow blade was manufactured from the hub to the tip. It enables the formation of self-induced internal flow through internal passages. The internal flow enters the passage of the hollow blade through the opening near the fan hub and exits through the trailing edge slots at the tip of the hollow blade. The study of the influence of internal flow on the flow field of axial fan and modifications of axial fan aerodynamic characteristics is presented. The characteristics of the axial fan with the internal flow were compared to characteristics of a geometrically equivalent fan without internal flow. The results show integral measurements of performance testing using standardized test rig and the measurements of local characteristics. The measurements of local characteristics were performed with a hotwire anemometry and a five-hole probe. Reduction in adverse flow conditions near the trailing edge at the tip of the hollow blade, boundary-layer reduction in the hollow blade suction side, and reduction in flow separation were attained. The introduction of the self-induced blowing led to the preservation of external flow direction defined by the blade geometry, which enabled maximal local energy conversion. The integral characteristic reached a higher degree of efficiency.	usa	American Society of Mechanical Engineers	2009	1.01	Journal of fluids engineering	0.452	0.969

11121179	Static and dynamic characteristics of a hydraulic Wheatstone bridge mass flowmeter	The hydraulic Wheatstone measuring bridge is a potential linear-flowmeter solution for direct mass flow measurements. In a concrete example of the flowmeter, four matched orifices are used as the local flow restrictors in the bridge network. This paper presents an analysis of the nonlinearity of the static measuring characteristics of the hydraulic measuring bridge, which results from the impact of the flow rate on the local pressure loss coefficient of the orifices. The results of the experimental analysis were confirmed with solutions of the physical-mathematical model of the flowmeter. Another objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of this flowmeter for pulsating flow measurements. For this reason, a dynamic model of the flowmeter was built by upgrading the steady-state flow model with the effects of fluid compressibility and inertia. Since the flowmeters characteristic is linear, it was found to be unaffected by the square root errors, which is the case with standard pressure differential flowmeters. On the other hand, the flowmeters frequency characteristic exhibited a typical resonance, the value of which depends on the fluid and the dimensional properties of the bridge.	gbr	Butterworth	2009	1.01	Flow measurement and instrumentation	0.721	0.969
11135254	Sol-gel-based optical sensor for the detection of aqueous amines	We present an optical sensor for the detection of aqueous amines obtained by incorporating chromoionophore XV (ETHT 4001) into sol-gel thin films. Acid- and base-catalyzed sol-gel processes were studied to prepare stable ormosil layers using various amounts of organically modified sol-gel precursor such asmethyltriethoxysilane (MTriEOS). The sensor layers were coated with a protective layer of microporous white polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in order to prevent interference from ions and ambient light. The measurements were carried out in a flow-through cell in the reflection mode. Acid-catalyzed ormosil layers (pH 1) based on the copolymerization of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and MTriEOS did not show any change in signal upon exposure to aqueous amine solutions, while base-catalyzed sensor layers (pH 3 and 13) showed significant changes in signal. The response time (t100) for the base-catalyzedsensor layer L3 (pH 13) upon exposure to different solutions containing 0-608 mmol L-1 aqueous propylamine was 20-30 s, the regeneration time was 70 s and the detection limit was 0.1 mmol L-1. The sensor response was reproducible and reversible. The porous ormosil layers permit dry sensor storage conditions.	nld	Springer	2007	1.01	Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry	2.867	1.847
1113736	Quantitative trait loci affecting growth in high growth (hg) mice	A genome-wide scan performed in order to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with growth in a population segregating high growth (hg), a partially recessive mutation that enhances growth rate and body size in the mouse. A sample of 262 hg/hg mice was selected from C57BL/6J-hg/hg x CAST/EiJ F[down]2 cross and typed with 79 SSLP markers distributed across the genome. Eight significant loci were identified through interval mapping. Loci on Chromosomes (CHRS) 2 and 8 affected the growth of F [down]2 mice. Loci on Chr 2 and 11 affected growth rate and carcass lean mass (protein and ash). A locus on Chr 9 modified femur length and another one in Chr 17 affcted both carcass lean mass and femur length, but none of these had significant effects on growth rate. Loci on Chrs 5 and 9 modified carcass fat content. Additive effects were positive for C5BL/6J alleles, except for the two loci affecting carcass fatness. Typing of selelcted markers in 274 +/+F[down]2 mice revealed significant interactions between hg and other growth QTL, which were detected as changes in gene action (additive or dominant) and in allele substitution effects. Knowledge about interactions between loci, especially when major genes are involved, will help in the identification of positional candidate genes in the understanding of the complex genetic regulation of growth rate and body size in mammals.	usa	Springer	2001	1.01	Mammalian genome	2.318	1.706

11139350	An integrity analysis of washing machine holders	The paper deals with structure integrity analysis of the holder for the carrying cross of a washing machine drum. Premature fracture of the holder occurred between mechanical sustainable tests of washing machine in the factory. In order to prevent fracture, the task was to determine the reasons for premature fracture of the holder and to estimate the suitability of the new design of the holder cross. Input data for structure integriry analysis were obtained by material by mechanical testing of used materials. Stress and strain analysis of holder limit load was performed by finite element modeling of holder. Dynamic tests of holders with two different thicknesses were done on a servo-hydraulic machine in order to find dynamical strength and endurance of holder. Fracture behaviour of holders is defined as initiation and propagation of crack. The obtained behaviour confirmed that the new design of holders reduces stress concentration in the critical region. Consequently, the new holder subjected to the same dynamic load can endure a higher number of cycles until breakage. The total number of cycles overcomes industrial testing requirements.	svn	Intitut za kovinske materiale in tehnologije	2007	1.01	Materiali in tehnologije	0.143	2.034
11139611	The influence of viscosity on the friction in lubricated DLC contacts at various sliding velocities	Diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings are one of the promising types of protective coatings for various mechanical applications, including those under lubricated conditions. In recent years the research focus of lubricated DLC contacts has been primarily on the chemical aspects of lubrication, while the physical properties of the oils and the other physical lubrication aspectswere to a large extent neglected. In this work we analyse the friction behaviour of self-mated DLC/DLC contacts that use various viscosity grades of polyalphaolefin (PAO) base oils, i.e., 18, 30 and 46 mm2/s, at a range of velocities from 0.04 to 0.41 m/s. For a comparison, we also investigated some steel/steel contacts. At low velocities (up to 0.08 m/s) we observed almost no effect of the viscosity for the DLC surfaces, suggesting a predominant influence of the DLC solid-solid contacts on the friction. However, relatively strong, physically adsorbed oil-film layers were present on the DLCsurfaces, which were able to prevent the coatings from wearing out under low-speed conditions, that otherwise occur under dry conditions. In the high-velocity region (above 0.17 m/s), the viscosity has no effect on the steel contacts, but higher-viscosity oils tended to reduce the DLC friction, suggesting that for DLC surfaces, higher viscosities are required for the same film thickness and quality of lubrication than for steel surfaces. This is due to the poorer wetting and oil-adsorption properties of DLC compared to steel. However, at the same time, this effect leads to reduced friction in DLCcontacts, which was about 15% lower for all the investigated sliding velocities.	gbr	Butterworth Scientific Limited	2009	1.01	Tribology international	1.690	0.969

11143196	Influence of organizational factors on management tools usage in Slovenian organizations	Purpose - In the global competitive environment, managers of organizations must permanently rethink and renew their work, especially about the use of different managerial tools. A selection of suitable management tools for organization requires consideration of characteristics of the known tools, comparison of different tools, and consideration of demands and conditions of the organizations. But direct comparison of different management tools is not possible because of their content-related and methodological differences. In management theory, various authors tried to consider the use of management tools more deeply. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of important organizational factors on usage of single management tools in Slovenian organizations. Thus, we consider: 1) usage patterns of management tools in different areas worldwide, 2) the influence of single organizational factors - i.e. education, position, and working years, on the usage of management tools in Slovenian organizations, and 3) the influence of a linear combination of selected factors on usage of management tools in Slovenian organizations. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative analysis is applied on the basis of the selected cognitions from Management, and Organization. The quantitative analysis includes desk research about the management tools, and analysis of the results from a survey about management tools in Slovenian organizations in 2010. In examining the impact of the considered organizational factors (separately and in combination) on management tools we use linear regression analysis to predict the influence of single factors and linear combination of the selected factors on the use of selected management tools. AMOS 17.0 was used for analysis. Findings - Intensity of management tools usage in Slovenian organizations is similar to the global patterns, while patterns of their usage are rather different. Examination of factors influencing usage of the top five management tools in Slovenian organizations reveal: education has the strongest impact on the usage of management tools, the impact of employees' position in organization is weaker, and the impact of working years is very weak. When we take into consideration all three predictors simultaneously, the impact of education and position becomes weaker, while the impact of working years becomes insignificant. We apply a deeper approach to gauge the influence of organizational factors on usage of the selected management tools. The impact of other considered factors, we find, is not significant. Research limitations/implications - Research is limited to a hypothesis, broader qualitative aspects encountered during desk research, and some quantitative analysis of results from our survey. We test our hypotheses and the chosen model on the top five management tools most used by employees in Slovenian organizations. Practical implications - Authors try to overcome the prevailing practice of very general consideration of management tools usage, especially regarding organizational factors, which influence the usage of management tools. Authors suggest a new approach, hardly known in the main-stream literature. They propose a more specific and target-oriented approach to consideration of management tools usage in business. Originality/value - Available management literature does not provide a similar solution for considering and researching the usage of management tools in business. This is useful for business practice in organizations, for advancing the usage of management tools, since the most important organizational factors on management tools usage are outlined.	ltu	Technologija.	2012	1.01	Ininerin¹e ekonomika	1.468	1.032
11143958	A fracture mechanics model for the analysis of micro-pitting in regard to lubricated rolling-sliding contact problems	A computational model is presented for the analysis of micro-pitting in regardto lubricated rolling-sliding contact problems. This model assumes the appearance of an initial microcrack on the contact surface due to the mechanical or thermal treatment of the material, and as a consequence of an on-going process in early the stage of exploitation. The discretised model of the contacting mechanical elements is subjected to normal loading (Hertzian contact pressure), tangential loading (friction between contacting surfaces) and internal pressure to the crack surfaces. Crack propagation is predicted as follows: (1) using modified maximum tangential stress criterion, which takes into account the influence of stress intensity factors KI and KII, T-stress, stress on the crackæs surface caused by lubricant pressure inside the crack, and the critical distance ahead of the crack tip and (2) the classical maximum tangential stress criterion, which only takes into account the influence of the stress intensity factors KI and KII. The stress intensity factor based on these two criteria is then used in a short crack growth theory to determine the fatigue life of an initial crack to extent up to micro-pit. The developed model is applied to a real spur gear pair.	gbr	Elsevier	2007	1.01	International journal of fatigue	1.117	0.706
11144470	Numerical modelling of crack path in the lubricated rolling-sliding contact problems	A two-dimensional computational model for simulation of contact fatigue of lubricated rolling-sliding contact problems is presented. In the model it is assumed that the initial crack of length 0.02 mm is initiated at the surface due to previous mechanical or heat treatment of the material as well as a consequence of running process in an early stage of exploitation. The discretised model with the initial crack is then subjected to the normal contact pressure and tangential loading due to friction between the contacting surfaces. The model also considers the moving contact of the contacting surfaces and fluid trapped in the crack. The crack propagation pathis predicted with the MTS and modified MTS criterion, which takes into account the influence of the stress intensity factor KI and KII, T-stress, stress on the crack surface caused by lubricant pressure inside the crack and critical distance ahead the crack tip. The numerical results correspond well with available experimental data.	usa	Pergamon Press.	2008	1.01	Engineering fracture mechanics	1.713	1.335
11144726	Inhibitory effect of non-ionic surfactants of the TRITON-X series on the corrosion of carbon steel in sulphuric acid	The corrosion inhibition characteristics of non-ionic surfactants of the TRITON-X series, known as TRITON-X-100 and TRITON-X-405, on stainless steel (SS) type X4Cr13 in sulphuric acid were investigated by potentiodynamic polarisation measurements. It was found that these surfactants act as good inhibitors of the corrosion of stainless steel in 2 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution, but the inhibition efficiency strongly depends on the electrode potential. Thepolarisation data showed that the non-ionic surfactants used in this study acted as mixed-type inhibitors and adsorb on the stainless steel surface, in agreement with the Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherm. Calculated Gads values are -57.79 kJ mol-1 for TRITON-X-100, and -87.5 kJ mol-1 for TRITON-X-405. From the molecular structure it can be supposed that these surfactants adsorb on the metal surface through two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms of the hydrophilic head group, suggesting a chemisorption mechanism.	nld	Pergamon Press	2007	1.01	Electrochimica Acta	2.848	1.992
11145494	The effect of a material's heterogeneity on the stress and strain distribution in the vicinity of a crack front	In this investigation a high-strength low-alloyed (HSLA) steel of the 700-MPa strength class was used as a base material. A butt-welded joint with X grooves was produced with an overmatched weld metal that had a yield strength 23 % greater than that of the base material. Three-point bending B x 2B test specimens (thickness B = 36 mm) were extracted from the welded joints. The straight crack front (a0 = 35,571 mm) crosses different microstructures through the thickness of the specimen. Both fracture-mechanics tests and a 3D finite-element analysis were performed. The CTOD parameter of the fracture toughness was measured and calculated numerically. The loading level at which stable crack growth occurred was also determined. The comparison of the experimental and numerical values of the CTOD (bs) displacements showed good agreement. The principal stress, ?$/delta_{y}$?, the Mises equivalent stress, ?$/delta_{eq}$?. and the plastic equivalent strain, ?$/epsilon_{pl, eq}$?, at the moment of crack initiation were studied for six equidistant layers from the surface to the mid-thickness of the specimen. The dependence of the crack-opening stress (denoted as ax in this paper) on the local fracture-toughness value was considered as the parameter which determines the direction of the crack-front propagation. The results show that the lower strength of the base metal contributes to the crack-path deviation in the mid-thickness of the specimen. Both the crack-path deviation and the higher toughness of the base metal increase the critical fracture toughness value of the welded joint.	svn	Intitut za kovinske materiale in tehnologije	2007	1.01	Materiali in tehnologije	0.143	2.034
11150108	Development of the Slovenian textile and clothing industry	The Slovenian textile and clothing industry began the transition phase and process of restructuring in the country. A number of firms and employees were significantly reduced at the time. When Slovenia entered the EU, the competitiveness of the industry had declined due to cheap imports of textile products mainly from Asian countries. The economic crisis and major changes in the European textile and clothing industries required faster and more effective adaptations to the current global situation in this industry. Thus, the EU began with projects concerning technology platforms and centers of excellence. Slovenia also has adapted similar projects with technological platforms and the integration of textile and clothing firms into clusters, which should lead to greater competitiveness for the Slovenian textile and clothing industry.	rou	Editura Certex	2012	1.01	Industria textilaa	0.291	0.821

11151131	Capability of high pressure cooling in the turning of surface hardened piston rods	An experimental study was performed to investigate the capabilities of dry, conventional and high pressure cooling (HPC) in the turning of surface hardened piston rods used in fluid power applications. Machining experiments were performed using coated carbide tools at cutting speeds up to 160 m/min. The cooling capabilities are compared by monitoring of chip breakability, process regions of operability, cooling efficiency, tool wear, tool life and cutting forces. Test results showed that dry cutting could not be performed due to long and ductile chips that were formed for all investigated cutting conditions. In comparison to conventional cooling the significant increase of cutting speed and feed rate region of operability was recorded when machining with HPC. Tool life analysis proved a five times increase in tool life when machining with HPC. Furthermore HPC also improved chip breakability and reduced coolant consumption.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	1.567	1.019

Design: Retrospective analysis of cycles comparing outcomes of day 2 and day 5 transfers. Our day 2 group was from the year 1999 and our day 5 group, from the year 2000. Setting: Assisted reproductive technology program of a teaching hospital. Patient(s): All patients, irrespective of age, who had developed one or two embryos. Intervention(s): Stimulated IVF, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or testicular sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles with 2-day culture in universal IVF medium (n = 133) or 5-day culture in BlastAssist media (MediCult, Jyllinge, Denmark; n = 132). Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy, implantation, and take-home baby rates. Result(s): In the groups of 2-day and 5-day culture, embryo transfer was performed in 98% and in 57% of cycles, respectively. However, the total implantation rate per created embryo (18% vs. 18%), the pregnancy rate per cycle (23% vs. 21%), and the take-home baby rate (69.4% vs. 71.4%) did not differ between the day 2 and day 5 groups. Conclusion(s): Extended culture of embryos does not improve or decrease their capacity for implantation but only allows for better selection and is therefore not necessary in cycles with fewer than three embryos.	usa	American Fertility Society	2002	1.01	Fertility and sterility	3.202	1.357
11155227	Analysis of test rig drive for air springs	To determine the life of air springs, a new test rig enabling dynamic sinusoidal loading of air springs has been developed. The test rig enables the adjustment of air spring deformation and load frequency, as well as the adjustment of its geometry to different sizes of air springs. Four air springs are tested simultaneously. Between the phases of loading the air spring some time delay occurs, which is why the work that the air spring returns into the drive system during its unloading is consumed as well. The concept of the test rig and the possibilities of adjustments are presented. In order to carry out a dynamic analysis of the drive and determine the load ontest rig elements, computer program has been developed enabling the calculation of the forces, torques, and power of the driving motor for different sizes of air springs and various testing conditions. The algorithms that the program is based on and the characteristic results of the calculations are presented.

To assess the value of Gd-DTPA magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the demonstration of marginal destructive discovertebral Romanus lesions in ankylosing spondylitis. Design and patients. A prospective study of Gd-DTPA MRimaging was performed in 39 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ankylosingspondylitis and typical Romanus lesions seen on radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine. MR morphological appearances and signal intensity changesat the discovertebral junctions were analysed and compared with the radiographic findings. Results. Ninetynine discovertebral junctions with Romanus lesions showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal on T2-weighted and TI-weighted postcontrast images at the vertebral corners consistent with oedematous hyperaemic inflammatory tissue. There were nine discovertebral junctions with similar MR findings but normal radiographs. Fifty-three discovertebral junctions showed syndesmophyte formation with increased signal intensity on both T1- and T2- weighted images with no contrast enhancement. Sixty-five discovenebral junctions showed a mixture of radiographic features and varied high and low signal changes at the venebral rim on MR imaging with rims of enhancement in the venebral body following contrast administration. Conclusion. Gd-DTPA MR imaging demonstrates a variable signal pattern and degree of contrast enhancement which may reflect the evolu- tionary stages of discovertebral enthesitis in ankylosing spondylitis. MR imaging may identify early erosive changes in radiographicallynormal venebra. The role of MR imaging needs funher investigation.	deu	Springer International	2000	1.01	Skeletal radiology	0.695	1.436
11156507	Online assessment of power transmission belt geometry by using laser triangulation and profile parameterisation	We present a method that enables an automated assessment of the geometrical dimensions of power transmission belts and the detection of surface defects and small deviations from the ideal shape that are difficult to detect with a visual inspection. The method is based on the acquisition of belt surface profiles using a laser triangulation and automated profile assessment based on a customdeveloped algorithm. The algorithm uses a novel approach to profile segmentation, featuring a template that defines the expected profile shape in advance and so, allows a faster implementation of the algorithm. It enables an automated calculation of the basic geometrical dimensions, which define the profile shape in the technical drawing and are important for online quality control in the production line. A macrolanguage was developed for a rapid and flexible definition of the mathematical operations used in the calculation of the profile's dimensions and thus, an adaptation to the requirements of a particular application. We demonstrate the use of the automatic belt profile geometry assessment on randomly chosen samples.	gbr	IFS Publications	2010	1.01	International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	1.068	1.019
11157526	On the local variation of the crack driving force in a double mismatched weld	A material inhomogeneity in the direction of crack extension causes a difference between the near-tip crack driving force, Jtip, and the nominally applied far-field crack driving force, Jfar. This difference can be quantified by a material inhomogeneity term, Cinh, which is evaluated by a post-processing procedure to a conventional finite element stress analysis. The magnitude of the material inhomogeneity term is evaluated for cracks in an inhomogeneous welded joint made of a high-strength low-alloy steel. Both a crack proceeding from the under-matched (UM) to the over-matched (OM) and from the OM to the UM weld metal are treated. The effects of the inhomogeneity of the different material parameters (modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and strain hardening exponent) on Cinh and Jtip are systematically studied. The results demonstrate that the material inhomogeneity term is primarily influenced by the inhomogeneity of the yield strength. A crack growing towards an OM/UM interface experiences an accelerated crack growth rate or a pop-in, an UM/OM interface leads to a reduced crack growth rate or a crack arrest. The application of global assessment methods of the mismatch effect which are included in the Engineering Treatment Model (ETM) or in the Structural Integrity Assessment Procedures for European Industry (SINTAP) is discussed.	usa	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	Engineering fracture mechanics	1.227	1.049

Ten haemodialysis patients with analgesic nephropathy (group I) and 19 haemodialysis patients where renal failure was not caused by analgesic nephropathy (group II) were included in the study. All patients were female without diabetes. Using B-mode ultrasonography, we compared intima-media thickness (IMT) in the carotid arteries and plaque occurrence, and their thickness in group I with that in group II. The possible differences in atherosclerotic risk factors in both groups were also investigated. In group I, the average age was 60.2 years, and the average dialysis treatment was 55.7 months. In group II, the average age was 54.6 years, and the average duration of dialysis treatment was 50.4 months. We found no statistically significant difference in the age and duration of dialysis treatment between groups I and II. The IMT values of the carotid arteries (0.97 vs 0.78 mm; P = 0.027) were significantly higher in group I. More patients had plaques in group I (90 vs 57.9%), and the number of plaques (P = 0.037) and their thickness (P = 0.043) were significantly higher in this group. There was no statistically significant difference in the atherosclerotic risk factors between groups I and II. The results indicate that patients with analgesic nephropathy treated with haemodialysis showed advanced atherosclerosis compared with other haemodialysis patients, despite no difference being found in the atherosclerotic risk factors between these patients.	aus	Blackwell Science	2002	1.01	Nephrology.	0.244	1.661
11160091	Improved explicit integration in plasticity	The article presents a simple but efficient numerical scheme for the integration of non-linear constitutive equations, in which the principal reason for the inaccuracy of the classical explicit schemes, for example forward-Euler scheme, is effectively eliminated. In the newly developed explicit scheme, where there is no need for iteration, the implementation simplicity of the forward-Euler scheme and accuracy of the approach, which is using the backward-Euler scheme to integrate the constitutive equations, are successfully combined. Computational performance of the proposed next increment corrects error (NICE) integration scheme, particularly regarding the accuracy and the CPU time consumption, is first analysed on a case of complex loading of a material point. When comparing it to the forward-Euler, backward-Euler, trapezoidal and midpoint integration schemes, it turns out that because of its capability of a fast and relatively accurate integration of the constitutive equations, the NICE scheme is very convenient for the integration of constitutive models, where a direct solution technique is used to solve a boundary value problem. Although the deduction of the new integration scheme is general, its implementation for shell applications needs particular care. Namely, in order to satisfy the zero normal stress condition during the whole integration, a through-thickness strain increment has to be adequately chosen in each integration step. The NICE scheme, which was also implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit via User Material Subroutine (VUMAT)interface platform, has been additionally compared with the ABAQUS/Explicit default integration scheme (backward-Euler) and forward-Euler scheme. Two loading case-studies, namely the bending of a square plate and the stretching of a specimen including the onset of necking, are considered with two constitutive models - the von Mises and GTN material model being adopted. Generally, the NICE scheme has demonstrated to be advantageous in cases, where reasonable accuracy and very fast integration of the constitutive model is demanded, which is mostly the case in engineering computations with a direct solution method, for example explicit dynamics and metal forming process simulations.	gbr	Wiley	2010	1.01	International journal for numerical methods in engineering	1.925	0.826
11160347	NICE-an explicit numerical scheme for efficient integration of nonlinear constitutive equations	The paper presents a simple but efficient new numerical scheme for the integration of nonlinear constitutive equations. Although it can be used for the integration of a system of algebraic and differential equations in general, the scheme is primarily developed for use with the direct solution methods for solving boundary value problems, e.g. explicit dynamic analysis inABAQUS/Explicit. In the developed explicit scheme, where no iteration is required, the implementation simplicity of the forward-Euler scheme and the accuracy of the backward-Euler scheme are successfully combined. The properties of the proposed NICE scheme, which was also implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit via User Material Subroutine (VUMAT) interface platform, are compared with the properties of the classical forward-Euler scheme and backward-Euler scheme. For this purpose two highly nonlinear examples, with the von Mises and GTN material model considered, have been studied. The accuracy of the new scheme is demonstrated to be at least of the same level as experienced by the backward-Euler scheme, if we compare them on the condition of the same CPU time consumption. Besides, the simplicity of the NICE scheme, which is due to implementation similarity with the classical forward-Euler scheme, is its great Advantage.	nld	North-Holland	2009	1.01	Mathematics and computers in simulation	0.946	0.985
11161110	Chemometric characterisation of the quality of ground waters from different wells in Slovenia	The quality of ground water as a source of drinking water in Slovenia is regularly monitored. One of the monitoring programmes is performed on 5 wells for drinking water supply, 3 industrial wells and 2 ground water monitoring wells. Two hundred and fourteen samples of ground waters were analysed in the time 2003-2004. Samples were gathered from ten different sampling sites and physical chemical measurements were performed. The following 13 physical chemical parameters were regularly controlled: temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrate, AOX (adsorbable organic halogens), metals such as chromium, pesticides (desethyl atrazine, atrazine and 2,6-dichlorobenzamide), highly-volatile halogenated hydrocarbons (trichlorometane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 1,1,2-trichloroethene). For handling the results different chemometrics methods were employed, such as basic statistical methods for the determination of mean and median values, standard deviations, minimal and maximal values of measured parameters and their mutual correlation coefficients, cluster analysis (CA), the principal component analysis (PCA), the clustering method based on Kohonen neural network, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The study gives the opportunity to follow the quality of ground waters at different sampling sites within the defined time period. Monitoring of general pollution of ground waters and following measuring can be used to search the pollution source, to plan prevention measures and to protect from pollution, as well.	svn	Slovensko kemijsko drutvo =Slovenian Chemical Society	2007	1.01	Acta chimica slovenica	1.093	2.086
11161622	Multivariate data analysis of natural mineral waters	Fifty samples of natural mineral waters from springs in Slovenia, Hungary, Germany, Czech Republic and further countries of former Yugoslavia have been analysed. The mass concentration of cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, NH4+) and anions (F-, Cl-, I-, NO3-, SO4 2-, HCO3-), the spring temperature, pH, conductivity and carbon dioxide mass concentration have been measured using standard analytical methods. Appropriate statistical methods and different chemometric tools were used to evaluate the obtained data, namely, (i) descriptive statistics, (ii) principal component analysis (PCA), (iii) cluster analysis, and (iv) linear discriminant analysis (LDA). It was confirmed that Slovenian natural mineral water samples differ most from the German ones but are relatively similar to the Czech and Hungarian ones. Water samples from Hungary are similar to waters from the eastern part of Slovenia.	svn	Slovensko kemijsko drutvo =Slovenian Chemical Society	2007	1.01	Acta chimica slovenica	1.093	2.086
11161817	Plurypotency of 17[beta]-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from the filamentous fungus Cochliobolus lunatus	Cochliobolus lunatus 17B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17B-HSD) is pluripotentfor several steroidal and nonsteroidal substrates. In the presence of NADPH the enzyme was found to reduce 3-keto groups of 4,5-dihydro steroids,20-keto groups, and most efficiently,17-keto groups of steroidal substrates. In addition, several quinones were accepted and found to be even better substrates as steroids due to their higher affinity for the enzyme-coenzyme complex and faster conversion of the enzyme-coenzyme-substratecomplex into the corresponding products. As suggestedby the competition studies quinones and 17-ketosteroids are convertedby the same active center of the enzyme. For all tested substrates, the equilibrium ordered mechanism was established with NADPH binding first to the enzyme. According to our knowledge, the investigated 17B-HSD is the first known fungal pluripotent enzyme of this type.	usa	Holden-Day.	2000	1.01	Steroids	1.831	3.06
11162073	Characterisation of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato strains isolated from patients with skin manifestations of Lyme borreliosis residing in Slovenia	Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne infection in Slovenia. Skin disorders are the most frequent clinical manifestations. The aim of the present study was to assess the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of a large number of human Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato isolates and to evaluate any association between the isolates and different clinical manifestations. All 103 strains tested were from patients suffering from the skin disorders of Lyme borreliosis. Skin biopsies, cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples from patients were inoculated into modified Kelly Pettenkofer medium. Protein profiles were determined by SDS-PAGE and species identification and plasmid profiles by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Mlu I digestion profiles showed that 87 (84.5%) isolates belonged to B. afzelii, 15 (14.5%) to B. garinii and 1 (1%) to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The number of plasmids in each strain varied from three to seven, and the plasmid size ranged from 15 to 65 kb. Fourisolates of B. garinii possessed multiple large plasmids and four isolateshad a large plasmid dimer (three B. afzelii and one B. garinii). Isolates showed qualitative and quantitative differences in protein expression. The study found differences in the expression of OspB and OspC proteins between B. afzelii and B. garinii strains. OspB was expressed significantly more often by B. afzelii (78 of 87, 89.6%) than by B. garinii (4of 15, 26.6%) isolates, while OspC protein was expressed significantly more often by B. garinii (14 of 15, 93.3%) than by B. afzelii (51 of 87, 58.6%) isolates. In Slovenia, B. afzelii causes the majority of skin lesions. The isolates investigated showed plasmid and protein diversity. Heterogeneity of the spirochaetes may be important for virulence, and may have implications forpathogenesis and therapy of the infection. Differences in immunodominat proteins also have an important impact on serological testing and vaccine development.	gbr	Livingstone;Society for General Microbiology	2000	1.01	Journal of medical microbiology	1.625	2.225
1116265	Trajectories of change in depression severity during treatment with antidepressants	Background. Response and remission defined by cut-off values on the last observed depression severity score are commonly used as outcome criteria in clinical trials, but ignore the time course of symptomatic change and may lead to inefficient analyses. We explore alternative categorization of outcome by naturally occurring trajectories of symptom change. Method. Growth mixture models were applied to repeated measurements of depression severity in 807 participants with major depression treated for 12 weeks with escitalopram or nortriptyline in the part-randomized Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression study. Latent trajectory classes were validated as outcomes in drug efficacy comparison and pharmacogenetic analyses. Results. The final two-piece growth mixture model categorized participants into a majority (75%) following a gradual improvement trajectory and the remainder following a trajectory with rapid initial improvement. The rapid improvement trajectory was over-represented among nortriptyline-treated participants and showed an antidepressant-specific pattern of pharmacogenetic associations. In contrast, conventional response and remission favoured escitalopram and produced chance results in pharmacogenetic analyses. Controlling for drop-out reduced drug differences on response and remission but did not affect latent trajectory results. Conclusions. Latent trajectory mixture models capture heterogeneity in the development of clinical response after the initiation of antidepressants and provide an outcome that is distinct from traditional endpoint measures. It differentiates between antidepressants with different modes of action and is robust against bias due to differential discontinuation.	gbr	British Medical Assoc	2010	1.01	Psychological medicine	5.200	1.77

Significant differences relating to emotional intelligence were observed in induced and event related band power in the theta (4.4-6.4 Hz), lower-2 alpha (8.4-10.4 Hz), and upper alpha band (10.4-12.4 Hz). High emotional intelligent individuals displayed less desynchronization in the upper alpha band, as well as more left hemispheric theta desynchronization. Further a significant positive correlation between the mean frequency and emotional intelligence was observed.

11163670	Event-driven current control structure for a three phase inverter	This paper discusses the functionality of a three-phase inverter from a discrete-event point of view. A recently developed vector-matrix recursive approach for the modeling of discrete event systems is applied for the design of a new, event-driven current control principle for a current controlled three phase inverter. The proposed event-driven current controller integrates traditionally separated current controller, and modulator. Transistor switching patterns are evaluated directly from the phase current errors and the voltage sector, and sequential switching among the transistor patterns is introduced to reduce switching frequency. Jn order to describe total functionality of a three phase inverter, the proposed modeling approach is further used for the design of steering and protection functions. The designed current controlled inverter is used for the speedlcurrent control of a permanent magnet synchronous mac hine. The presented experiment shows that the introduced recursive matrix based approach for the modeling of discrete event systems o.ffers a simple mapping procedure for rapid implementation of the designed control algorithms on the FPGA platform.	ita	Praise Worthy Prize	2007	1.01	International review of electrical engineering	0.570	1.193
11164438	Uncertainty of the result of TOC determination in water samples	The production of micrometric particles of Disperse Red 60 pigment was studied using two supercritical fluids based techniques: the supercritical antisolvent precipitation (SAS) and the supercritical assisted atomisation (SAA). We studied the influence of some process parameters on the final product: the variation of the dye concentration in the solvent using the SAS technique, and supercritical fluid/liquid solvent flow ratio, temperature and concentration in the liquid solution using SAA technique. These parameters allow the control of the particle size of the produced powders. Using SAS, we obtained Disperse Red 60 as spherical nano-particles with mean diameters ranging between 50 and 100 nm. Very long needle-like crystals were also obtained at some process conditions. Using SAA, quasi-spherical crystals with mean diameters ranging between 0.5 and 2.5 m were produced. Therefore, in the case of Disperse Red 60, the two processes demonstrate to be complementary: nanometric particles can be obtained using SAS, whereas micrometric particles are produced using SAA.	deu	Springer-Verlag	2007	1.01	Accreditation and quality assurance	0.717	1.034
11164694	Effects of biodiesel on emissions of a bus diesel engine	This paper discusses the influence of biodiesel on the injection, spray, and engine characteristics with the aim to reduce harmful emissions. The considered engine is a bus diesel engine with injection M system. The injection, fuel spray, and engine characteristics, obtained with biodiesel, are compared to those obtained with mineral diesel (D2) under various operating regimes. The considered fuel is neat biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Its density, viscosity, surface tension, and sound velocity are determined experimentally and compared to those of D2. The obtained results are used to analyze the most important injection, fuel spray, and engine characteristics. The injection characteristics are determined numerically under the operating regimes, corresponding to the 13 mode ESC test. The fuel spray is obtained experimentally under peak torque condition. Engine characteristics are determined experimentally under 13 mode ESC test conditions. The results indicate that, by using biodiesel, harmful emissions (NOx, CO, smoke and HC) can be reduced to some extent by adjusting the injection pump timing properly.	nld	Elsevier Applied Science	2008	1.01	Bioresource technology	4.453	1.329
1116521	Mobility and functional outcomes after femoral neck fracture surgery in elderly patients	Purpose. To find out whether patients with femoral neck fracture treated with hemiarthroplasty differ from those treated with internal fixation regarding functional outcome, walking ability, pain or short-term mortality. Method. Sixty-six patients aged 64 years or more with femoral neck fracture were included in a prospective non-randomised trial with two equal-sized groups recruited consecutively within each group. All patients were treated operatively and encouraged to pursue an active rehabilitation. They were reviewed at admission, before discharge and 3 months after surgery. Assessments included demographic data, length of hospitalisation, post-operative medical complications, activities of daily living, walking ability, pain and mortality. Results. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, ability to walk, functional status or at admission. The patients treated with hemiarthroplasty had a longer total hospital stay due to longer waiting time to operation. They started to walk sooner after operation and walked better during hospitalisation. Their walking distance at discharge was longer; their improvement in functional independence, as measured by the Functional Independence Measure, was also higher, but this difference was not statistically significant. Observed mortality in the hemiarthroplasty group was lower. Conclusion. A longer follow-up would be necessary to determine whether the preferable outcomes of hemiarthroplasty persist in the long-term.	gbr	Taylor & Francis	2011	1.01	Disability and rehabilitation	1.498	1.201
11165462	Determination of major phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes and triterpenes in Rosemary (Rosmarinus Officinalis L.) by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry	A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method for the simultaneous identification and quantification of seven major phenolic and terpenic compounds in Rosmarinus officinalis L. was developed. The compounds were identified as trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of phenolic acids (caffeic and rosmarinic acid), phenolic diterpene (carnosic acid), and pentacyclic triterpenes (ursolic, oleanolic, betulinic acid and betulin). These compounds have been identified by retention time and comparison of mass spectra. The procedure involves ultrasonic extraction using solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran and ethanol. Extracts were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) after purifying on graphitised carbon. The fraction with phenolic and terpenic compounds was derivatised prior to GC-MS analysis using N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) as a derivatisation reagent. The derivatisation process was optimized regarding temperature and reaction time. The linearity of the method was tested in concentration range 4-25 mg L-1. The correlation coefficients (r2) were in the range of 0.997 to 0.999. The average recoveries for all compounds ranged from 80 to 82%. The GC-MS technique is specific and sensitive, and can be used for simultaneous identification and determination of a wide range of phenolic and terpenic compounds in different plants even at trace levels.	svn	Slovensko kemijsko drutvo =Slovenian Chemical Society	2007	1.01	Acta chimica slovenica	1.093	2.086

1116886	Distribution of Cd, Pb, Zn, Mo and S in juvenile and mature Brassica napus L. var. napus	The study was conducted at three locations in the Savinjska region of Slovenia, where soil is contaminated with heavy metals due to the zinc industry (Cinkarna Celje). In Ponikva the soil to a depth of 30 cm contains 0.8 mg kg-1 Cd, 32.2 mg kg-1 Pb and 86 mg Zn kg-1, in Medlog 1.4 mg kg-1 Cd, 37.4 mg kg-1 Pb and 115 mg kg-1 Zn and in Skofja vas 10.9 mg kg-1 Cd, 239.7 mgkg-1 Pb and 1356 mg kg-1 Zn. The pH at the selected sites was between 7.3 and 7.6. In the beginning of September 2006 two hybrids of Brassica napus L. var. napus, PR45 D01 and PR46 W31 suitable for production of biodiesel obtained from Pioneer Seeds Holding GmbH, were sown. After 96 days juvenile and after 277 days mature plants were collected. Parts of plants (root, shoot and seed) were separated and Cd, Pb, Zn, Mo and S determined by ultra-trace ICP-MS. We compared the uptake of Cd, Pb, Zn, Mo and S in different parts of juvenile and mature plants of the two different hybrids, TF (translocation factor), BAF (bioaccumulation factor) and PP (phytoextraction potential) were calculated. The mature hybrid PR46 W31 had higher shootroot ratio and higher PP for metals (Cd, Pb and Zn) and lower PP for the micronutrient (Mo) and macronutrient (S) on the polluted site. The study demonstrated the potential use of oilseed rape on multiply polluted soils for production of 1st and 2nd generation biofuels.

The velocity-vorticity formulation is employed, where the kinematics is given with the Poisson equation for the velocity vector, while the kinetics is represented with the vorticity transport equation. Based on computational aspects, resulting from CPU time and memory requirements of the boundary domain integral method, a combined approach to the solution of the set of governing equations is proposed. Kinematics is solved using boundary element method (BEM), while kinetics is solved using finite element method (FEM). Lid driven flow in a cubic cavity was considered to show the robustnessand versatility of this formulation.

11170838	A noise robust feature extraction algorithm using joint wavelet packet subband decomposition and AR modeling of speech signals	This paper presents a noise robust feature extraction algorithm NRFE using joint wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and autoregressive (AR) modeling of a speech signal. In opposition to the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-based time-frequency signal representation, wavelet packet decomposition can lead to better representation of non-stationary parts of the speech signal (e.g. consonants). The vowels are well described with an AR model as in LPC analysis. The proposed Root-Log compression scheme is used to perform the computation of the wavelet packet parameters. The separately extracted WPD and AR-based parameters are combined together and then transformed with the usage of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to finally produce a lower dimensional output feature vector. The noise robustness is improved with the application of proposed wavelet-based denoising algorithm with a modified soft thresholding procedure and time-frequency adaptive threshold. The proposed voice activity detector based on a skewness-to-kurtosis ratio of the LPC residual signal is used to effectively perform a frame-dropping principle. The speech recognition results achieved on Aurora 2 and Aurora 3 databases show overall performance improvement of 44.7% and 48.2% relative to the baseline MFCC front-end, respectively.	nld	North-Holland	2007	1.01	Signal processing	0.737	0.927
1117142	Heavy metals and arsenic concentrations in ten fish species from the alek lakes (Slovenia)	The study, which measured the concentrations of Hg, Pb, Cd, Zn and As in various fish tissues (muscle, gill and liver) of 10 fish species (Abramis brama danubii, Alburnus alburnus alburnus, Barbus meridionalis petenyi, Carassius auratius gibelio, Cyprinus carpio, Lepomis gibossus, Leuciscius cephalus cephalus, Perca fluviatilis fluviatilis, Rutilus rutilus, Scardinus erythrophtlalmus erythrophtlalmus) collected in the alek lakes, is the first survey regarding metal concentrations in fish species with samples originatingfrom Slovene lakes, while only a limited number of such studies have been carried out in southeastern Europe. Since these lakes are situated in the close vicinity of the largest Slovene thermal power plant, the study provides an insight into the potential impact of increased levels of metals inthe environment as well as an estimate of the contamination of fish tissues with metals. Furthermore, it was possible to compare the results obtained withthose from other studies regarding metal levels in freshwater fish species. The mean metal concentrations of different tissues irrespective of species varied in the following ranges: Zn 4.31-199 mg/kg ww, Pb 0.01-0.48 mg/kg ww, As 0.02-0.44 mg/kg ww, Hg <0.01-0.31 mg/kg ww, Cd <0.01-0.19 mg/kg ww. In general, higher contents of Hg were found in muscles and livers than in gills and higher contents of As in gills and livers than in muscles, respectively. The accumulation of Pb and Zn was most pronounced in gills. The result obtained regarding metal concentrations in fish rvealed that the ecosystems of the alek lakes are not polluted with Hg and Pb, slightly loaded with As and Cd and moderatly polluted with Zn. In addition, the potential human health risk due to fish consumption was assessd. This showed that estimated weekly intakes for all metals were below provisional permissible tolerable weekly intakes determined by WHO/FAO. The consumption of fish from the alek lakes, therefore, does not pose a risk to human health.	nld	Reidel	2012	1.01	Environmental monitoring and assessment	1.400	1.997

11180377	Noninvasive characterisation of multiple ventricular events using electrocardiographic imaging	Distributions of epicardial potentials, calculated from body surface electrocardiograms (ECGs), were investigated to determine if they could enable detection of multiple sites of ventricular activity. An anatomical model of the human ventricular myocardium was used to simulate activation sequences initiated at nine different ventricular pairs of sites. From these sequences, body surface ECGs were simulated at 352 sites on the torso surface and then used to reconstruct epicardial potentials at 202 sites. The criterion for detection of dual, ventricular events was the presence of two distinct primary potential minima in the reconstructed epicardial potentials. The shortest distance between the two events in the right ventricle that resulted in the reconstruction of epicardial potential patterns, featuring two minima, was 27 mm; the distance between the two events in the left ventricle was 23 mm. When Gaussian white noise in the simulated body surface potentials was increased from 3 ?$\mu$?V to 15 ?$\mu$?V and 50 ?$\mu$?V, dual events become more difficult to distinguish. Findings indicate that calculated epicardial potentials provide useful visual information about the presence of multiple ventricular events that is not apparent in features of body surface ECGs, and could be particularly helpful an optimising mapping procedures during difficult or unsuccessful radiofrequency ablations of accessory pathways.	gbr	Peter Peregrinus	2001	1.01	Medical & biological engineering & computing	1.172	0.692
1118271	Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in a heterotopic pancreas	Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in heterotopic pancreas is a rare disease affecting younger men in particular. On account of its difficult diagnosis and nonspecific signs, it was first described in 1970. A 51-year-old male patient was admitted for clarification of several months of severe pain in the upper abdomen accompanied by weight-loss, and due to ultrasonically established suspicion of carcinoma in the head of the pancreas. Clinical examination and laboratory tests were nonsignificant. Barium meal and esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a severe deformation of the duodenum. Biopsy of the duodenal mucosa detected moderate inflammatory changes. Ultrasound examination showed cystic changes in the duodenal wall and in the vicinity of the head of the pancreas. Only with the aid of endoscopic ultrasound, could bizarre cystic changes in the submucosa of the duodenal wall be detected, which was also confirmed by computer tomography. The signs of disease are nonspecific. Duodenal biopsy also does not reveal its cause since the typical lesions lie deeper in the submucosa or muscularis propria. Cystic changes with fibrosis, pancreatic ducts and lobi without anatomic or vascular connection to the pancreas are found. The anomaly involves, above all, the stomach and duodenum. Prior to the introduction of imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasonography, computer tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance, the diagnosis could only be made by means of anoperative procedure. Treatment is primarily surgical; smaller cysts can be treated by endoscopic fenestration. Pharmacological treatment with somatostatin is rarely performed.	aut	Springer	2002	1.02	Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift	0.591	1.862

In the present work, lipase-catalysed production of n-octyl oleate by esterification of oleic acid with 1- octanol in dense CO2, as reaction medium, was performed in bench-scale packed-bed bioreactor, in order to obtain suitable reaction performance data for up-scaling. Lipase fromRhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme RM IM) was used as the biocatalyst. The experiments were planned to elucidate the effect of several process parameters, such as pressure, temperature, CO2 and substrates flow rates. Pressure of 10MPa, temperature of 323.15 K, CO2 flow rate of 210 dm3/h and substrates flow rate of 18 cm3/h were predicted to be the optimum conditions: a maximum yield of about 93% was attained. Performing the enzymatic reaction in the continuously operating bioreactor, a long-term enzyme lifetime was observed and a decrease of the Lipozyme activity was not registered over 50 days. A comparison with experimental results obtained in batch-wise was also proposed. Operating at the optimum reaction conditions, higher ester yield than those obtained in batch-mode was detected. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) showed to be a potential medium for the n-octyl oleate biosynthesis for a large-scale production in continuous-mode.	nld	PRA Press	2007	1.01	The Journal of supercritical fluids	2.189	1.015

Process conditions (pressure, temperature, stirrer speed, water concentration, substrates molar ratio and incubation time) were optimised performing experiments in a high-pressure batch stirred tank reactor (BSTR). Experiments were carried out in the operative pressure and temperature ranges 8-30MPa and 308.15-383.15 K, respectively. Pressure of 10MPa, temperature of 323.15 K, stirring rate of 300 rpm, fatty acid/alcohol concentration molar ratio 40/60, water concentration of 166.7 ?$\mu$? L/g reaction bulk, enzyme concentration of 25 mg/cm3 and incubation time of 5 h were found tobe the optimum reaction conditions. Operating at these conditions a maximum FFA conversion of 88% was attained. A comparison with reactions performed at atmospheric pressure in almost non-aqueous solvent-free medium and in n-hexane was also proposed. It resulted that CO2 expanded reaction mixture required lower enzyme concentrations, desired at commercial industrial scales,and enhanced the reaction kinetics with respect to the solvent-free system due to decrease of the interphase transport limitations. Higher fatty acid ester (FAE) concentration was also obtained in SC-CO2 when compared with those attained over n-hexane under identical reaction conditions.	nld	PRA Press	2007	1.01	The Journal of supercritical fluids	2.189	1.015

The first part of the paper presents the development and analysis of the structure for generating the magnetic field and the basic operational principle of the magnetic refrigerator concerned, and the second part gives a description of the development process for certain key elements of the complete magnetic refrigeration system.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2010	1.01	International journal of refrigeration	1.439	0.909
11193110	Pressure control in hydraulic systems with variable or constant pumps?	The paper deals with electrohydraulic supply systems with variable (adjustable( supply pressures. Two control concepts are used in practice: the pressure control concept using a variable pump and constant speed of the driving electric motor as the commonly used concept, and the pressure control concept with a constant pump and a speed-controlled electric motor as the alternative concept. The typical features and the applicability of both conceps, as well as their dynamic responses are studied in this work.	nld	Society for Experimental Stress Analysis	2007	1.01	Experimental techniques	0.400	0.579
11194329	The basis for presurgical orthopedic treatment of infants with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate	Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the posttreatment morphology of the upper part of the oral cavity of complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients and to compare it to noncleft contemporaries. Patients were treated according to a protocol designed to keep a proper resting posture of the oral cavity. Design: Retrospective study on dental casts. Setting: The study was performed at a maxillofacial center serving a popu- lation of 2 million inhabitants. Data for noncleft subjects are the result of a longitudinal study at the same lnstitution. Patients: Twenty-one Caucasian UCLP patients (13 males, 8 females) aged 5 to 9 years with no other congenital anomalies and no postoperative orthodontic treatment. Interventions: Each patient received 5 to 6 months of preoperative orthopedicswith a passive plate and external nonelastic strapping with definitive lip repair at age 5 to 7 months, soft palate repair at 11 to 15 months, and hard palate repair with mucoperiosteal closure of the alveolus at 30 to 36 months. Each patient was compared to the mean values obtained from a longitudinal study of a group of 25 healthy noncleft children of the same ethnic group (11 males,14 females). Results: Analysis of dental casts indicated that 16 patients had a width, depth, and length of the alveolar archin the range of the mean normal values minus two standard deviations. Their analyzed palates were flatter than normal. Six of 21 children had too small an alveolar arch for their ages, and they did not acquire a correct posture of the oral cavity. Conclusion: The results indicate that the upper part of the oral cavity of UCLP patients can reach the dimensions of noncleft contemporaries despite surgery.	usa	Decker Periodicals	2000	1.01	Cleft palate-craniofacial journal	0.718	1.146
11201302	Optimisation of needle penetration velocity using the link drive mechanism in a sewing machine	Needle movement in a standard lockstitch sewing machine is produced by a slider-crank mechanism. The needle moves in a vertical plane and penetrates the fabric on its way down. Friction between the needle and the fabric generates heat during the penetration phase. The heat causes severe problems during the sewing process, such as thread & fabric melting as well as residuesaround the needleæs eye. These cause thread or fabric damage and may interrupt the sewing process. One possibility of reducing heat generation is to reduce the needle penetration velocity. This is a function of the geometry of the sewing machineæs driving mechanism and the angular velocity of the mainshaft. Since friction is a function of needle penetration velocity, the heat generated is directly dependent on the configuration of the driving mechanism, as well as the sewing speed. The aim of this work is to introduce the possibility of replacing the slider-crank mechanism, which is typically used in sewing machines, with a link drive mechanism. With this type of mechanism we may be able to reduce the penetration velocity of the needle without any loss of sewing speed. The optimal geometry of the link drive is achieved using a non-linear optimisation procedure.	pol	Institute of Chemical Fibres	2007	1.01	Fibres & textiles in Eastern Europe	0.402	0.674

If for a given graph ?$G$? its respective 3D-drawing leads to a graph ?$G'$? identical to ?$G$?, i.e. if ?$G'(R)=G$?, the graph drawing algorithm is said to be self-consistent; otherwise is not self-consistent. The aim of a present paper is to improve the OS model by angles considerations. Sudh a model we call Overlapping Spheres with Angles (OSAN) Model. Two algorithms were developed within the OSAN model and their self-consistency was tested. The results obtained show that the OSAN model ensures a rather self-consistent and acceptable framework to reproduce to connectivity of molecules. Considering a group of graphs used in tests, a success rate of the OS model algorithm is 83% meanwhile a succes rate of the first OSAN algorithm reaches 95%.	deu	University of Kragujevac;Faculty of Science Kragujevac	2001	1.01	MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry	0.579	0.619

Background Data: A VSP-technology-based Er:YAG laser operating in MAX mode should be appropriate for achieving the maximum ablating speed in hard dental tissues. Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted on extracted, cleaned, sterilized human molar teeth. Cavity preparations were made in hard dental tissues using the VSP-technology Er:YAG laser in MAX mode,in enamel using the high-speed handpiece, and in dentin using the low-speed handpiece at different time intervals. A laser triangulation profilometer was used to determine cavity volumes. The cavity surfaces of five specimens were examined using SEM. Results: The Er:YAG laser removed a volume of enamel that was 3.3 times as large as that removed by the high-speedhandpiece in the same period of time. In dentin, the Er:YAG laser removed 8 to 18 times as much volume as the steel bur in the same period of time. The Er:YAG ablation rate in dentin was faster than in enamel. SEM of laser prepared cavities showed a well-defined surface, free of the smear layer. Conclusions: The VSP-technology-based Er:YAG laser, working in MAX mode, is more efficient than mechanical drills for enamel and dentin ablation.	usa	Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.	2009	1.01	Photomedicine and laser surgery	1.756	1.593
11207190	An algorithm for polygon clipping, and for determining polygon intersections and unions	This paper introduces a universal algorithm for polygon cIipping, wich is a frequent operation in GIS. In the proposed solution, the cIipping polygons can be concave and may include holes. This algorithm is based on so-called entry/exit intersection point property, which has to be explicitly determined only at the first calculated intersection point. It uses a simple but efficient data structure based on a single-linked list. Boolean union and the difference between input polygons can also be determined after small modifications. This algorithm can easily be adapted to Boolean operations between regions composed of polygon sets.	gbr	Pergamon Press	2007	1.01	Computers & Geosciences	0.893	1.122
11207707	Numerical simulation of stress relieving of an austenite stainless steel	An approach to numerical simulation of the annealing process with stress relieving is presented in the paper. For austenite stainless steel 316L (AISI), which exhibits no phase transformation from the melting point to room temperature, a viscous-elastic-plastic constitutive model is elaborated. First, from given experimental data the respective mechanical material parameters as a function of temperature are numerically identified by an inverse procedure. Then, the adequacy of the adopted model and identified material parameters is proven by a numerical simulation of stress relieving in two technological cases: (i) two-stage deep drawing with intermediate stress annealing and, (ii) simplified welding process followed by post weld heat treatment. In both cases the obtained residual stress state reduction is found to be in good agreement with the empirical experience and data provided from literature.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2009	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.533	0.969
11207944	Preliminary results of the scale of self-perception for pre-school children (LSPO)	The author describes the characteristic features of the child's self-perception with special emphasis on the pre-school period. She also mentions the stablished methods of measuring the child's self-perception. She points out that in creating the instruments for measuring self-perception of younger children, it is necessary to take into account some of their developmental psychological characteristic, such as short-span attention, inconsistency in their answers, tendency to give socially acceptable answers, etc. The author presents the Scale of self-perception for pre-school children (LSPO) which she herself developed on the basis of her findings and on the basis of the experience of other authors in the forming of psychological instruments of this type. The scale was tested in a research which involved 214 children attending kindergarten (they are 4 and 5 years old). The purpose of the study is to investigate the psychometric characteristics of LSPO. A factor analytical check of the data only partly confirmed that the a priori dimensions had been reliably measured. That is why in further analyses the author preferred to account for dimensions obtained on the basis of factor analysis. It was established that the psychometric characteristics of the scale were adequate.

1120881	Some physico-chemical properties of doxazosin mesylate polymorphic forms and its amorphous state	Seven polymorphic modifications of doxazosin mesylate, designed as forms A,D,F,G,H,I, and the amorphous state were studied by thermal methods (TG and DSC), temperature resolved X-ray powder diffractometry, hot stage and scanningelectron microscopy and by fast cooling of the melt in the DSC.Polymorhisms A and F were found to be stable in the temperature range from room temperature to their melting points at 277.9 and 276,5C respectively.Form G, which melts at 27.8C, was found to be hygroscopic. Polymorph D undergoes irreversible solid-liquid-solid phase transition at 235.5C to polymorph I which melt at 274.9Form H, which melts at 258.0C was found to be unstable at high temperatures.DSC examination revealed that form H is irreversibly transformed to polymorph F during heating above the temperature of about 240C.The amorphous state was found to be stable at room temperature but when heating above the glass transition (Tg=144.1C) it crystallizes at 221.6C, what leads into a mixture of polymorphic forms. The new polymorphic form designed as E was identified in the mixture. The polymorph E is converted by heating to the more stable form F. The solubilities at 25C for forms A, and F in methanol are 3.5 and 7.7mgL-1 and in water they are 3.8 and 6.2mgL-1, respectively.	nld	Kluwer;Akadémiai Kiadó	2002	1.01	Journal of thermal analysis and calorimetry	1.094	1.562

Most patients were male (70,6 %), the average age was 36.6 years and the majority of patients had been injured in traffic accidents.In 50% of cases, only the thighbone was broken, the rest had sufferred multiple injuries, or were polytraumatised. Their stay in hospital averaged 17 days, while the average time to union was 21 weeks. In most cases (85%), treatment proceeded with no complications. Chronical post-traumatic osteitis occured in 9 of the patients with open breaks (1.8%), and only in 2 patients (0.4%) with closed breaks, which is within the limits of tolerance. With respect to our experience and results with osteosynthesis with plates andscrews in the thighbone shaft, we belive that the mentioned meethod is goodand gives results which are comparable to those achived using other methods.	deu	Springer	2000	1.01	Der Unfallchirurg	0.496	1.146
11211481	Fuxiana yangi g.n., sp.n. (Crustacea: Amphipoda), a ""baikaloid"" amphipod from the depths of Fuxian Hu, an ancient lake in the karst of Yunnan, China	The first search for endemic invertebrate fauna in the lesser-known ancient lake Fuxian Hu revealed a depths inhabiting amphipod. Fuxiana yangi g.n., sp.n. is a ca. 2-3 mm long, stout, gammaroidean amphipod inclined to develop lateral protuberances. Taxonomically, the animal is a double enigma. (1) In spite of great polymorphism in its superficial trunk morphology - smooth, witha pair of horns, with pairs of lobes - the strong resemblance in appendagemorphology speaks for the conspecificity of four specimens. (2) In spite of the absence of the most striking character - peg-shaped palmar spines- the shape of female gnathopods and some other characters speak for itsphylogenetic relation to the north Pacific anisogammarid stock rather than to original (probably) Tethyan gammarid (s.str.) stock that reportedly gave rise to the rich amphipod flock of species and genera in Bajkalskoe Ozero (Lake Baikal). Morphologically, Fuxiana is convergent with many phylogenetically unrelated stocks of ancient lake amphipods. Biologically, it is a K-strategist with a small number of large eggs. It is accompanied by a very scarce fauna in the lake's depths. A small endemic flock of anisogammaridspecies inhabits the richer shallows.	deu	E.

11211542	Investigation of crack propagation scatter in a gear tooth's root	This paper describes the problem of determining crack initiation location and its influence on crack propagation in a gear tooth's root. Three different load positions on the gear tooth's flank were considered for this investigation of crack initiation and propagation. A special test device was used for the single tooth test. It can be concluded from the measurements thata crack can be initiated at very different locations in a tooth's root and then propagate along its own paths. A numerical investigation into a crack initiation's position and its influences on its propagation were carried out within the framework of linear fracture mechanics. The influence of a tooth's load position, the geometry of the tooth's root, and the influence of nonparallel load distribution on the tooth's flank were considered when investigating the crack initiation's position. Results show that linear fracture mechanics can be used for determining crack propagation, if better initial conditions for crack initiation are considered.	usa	Pergamon Press.	2008	1.01	Engineering fracture mechanics	1.713	1.335
11216601	Systemic infection with potato virus YNTN alters the structure and activity ofshoot apical meristem in a susceptible potato cultivar	Stem nodes of the potato virus YNTN (PVYNTN) susceptible potato cultivar (Solanum tuberosum cv. Igor) were studied to investigate whether alterations in shoot morphology caused by infection with PVYNTN are related to changes in structure and activity of the shoot apical meristem. The PVYNTN causes severe disease symptoms known as the potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD) in susceptible potato plants grown in the field. Although in stem node culturethe symptoms are mildly expressed, in systemically PVYNTN- infected plants the shoot height stem diameter, number of leaves and the total leaf area were lower than in the healthy control plants at day 18 and 35 of culture. Histological analysis of the longitudinal sections of the shoot tip revealed that the infected plants had smaller shoot apical meristems due primarily to a lower cell number in different meristem zones. One of the most affected zones of the apical shoot meristem was the peripheral zone, the region in which leaf primordia are induced. The data is consistent in showing that the infection of potato plants with PVYNTN leads to alterations in the shoot apical meristem structure and mitotic activity. These changes are, in turn, reflected in altered overall morphology of the infected plant.	gbr	Academic Press	2000	1.01	Physiological and molecular plant pathology	1.970	1.36
11217369	Lysine 77 is a key residue in aggregation of eguinatoxin II, a pore-forming txin from sea anemone Actinia equina	Among eighteen point mutants of equinatoxin II produced in E. coli, containinga single cystein substitution at variable position, EqtIIK77C was chosen for its peculiar properties. It was almost 100 times less hemolytic than the wild-type, but its hemolytic activity could be restored by chemical modification of the thiol group, provided that a positive charge was reintroduced. This indicates that a positive charge at this position is necessary for toxin activity. The mutant formed larger pores as compared to the wild type, but displayed the same cation selectivity. The pores reverted to normal size upon reintroduction of the positive charge. The conformation ofEqtIIK77C and its binding to lipid membranes, either vesicles or red blood cells, was almost normal. However the kinetics of calcein release from lipid vesicles was substantially slower than that of the wild-type. Taken together with the different size of the pore formed, this is an indication that mutation of Lys77 - Cys influences the normal development of the aggregate which is required for assembling the functional pore.	usa	Springer	2000	1.01	The journal of membrane biology	2.973	2.347
11217625	Structure-function studies of tryptophan mutants of equinatoxin II, a sea aneone pore-forming protein	Equinatoxin II (EqtII) is a eukaryotic cytolytic toxin that avidly creates pores in natural and model lipid membranes. It contains five tryptophan residues in three diflerent regions of the molecule. In order to study its interaction with the lipid membranes, three tryptophan mutants, EqtII Trp45, EqtII Trp116/117 and EqtII Trp149, were prepared in an Escherichia coli expression system (here, the tryptophan mutants are classified according to the position of the remaining tryptophan residue(s) in each mutated protein). They all possess a single intrinsic fluoresant centre. All mutants were less haemolytically active than the wild-type, although the mechanism of erythrocyte damage was the same. EqtII Trp116/117 resembles the wild-type in terms of its secondary structure content, as determined from Fourier-transforminfrared (FTIR) spectra and its fluorescent properties. Tryptophans at these two positions are buried within the hydrophobic interior of the protein, and are transferred to the lipid phase during the interaction with the lipid membrane. The secondary structure of the other two mutants, EqtII Trp45 and EqtII Trp149, was altered to a certain extent. EqtII Trp149 was the most dissimilar from the wild-type, displaying a higher content of random-coil structure. It also retained the lowest number of nitrogen-bound protons after exchange with 2H2O, which might indicate a reduced compactness of the molecule. Tryptophans in EqtII Trp45 and EqtII Trp149 were more exposedto water, and also remained as such in the membrane-bound form.	gbr	Biochemical Society	2000	1.01	Biochemical journal	4.280	3.06

When matured, these stinging organelles are capable of storing and delivering toxins. We hypothesized that translated nematocyst proteins might comprise specific sequences serving as signals in sorting to the organelle. A sodium channel neurotoxin from the sea anemone Actinia equina was cloned and the toxin precursor sequence was compared to those of nematocyst collagens, pore-forming toxins and ion channel neurotoxins. It was found that all the analyzed sequences possess a highly conserved stretch of nine amino acid residues ending with Lys-Arg N-terminally of the mature region.	nld	Elsevier	2000	1.01	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1.399	2.504

11223323	The ionization length in plasmas with finite temperature ion sources	The ionization length is an important quantity which up to now has been precisely determined only in plasmas which assume that the ions are born at rest, i.e., in discharges known as cold ion-source plasmas. Presented here are the results of our calculations of the ionization lengths in plasmas with an arbitrary ion source temperature. Harrison and Thompson (H&T) [Proc. Phys. Soc. 74, 145 (1959)] found the values of this quantity for the cases of several ion strength potential profiles in the well-known Tonks-Langmuir [Phys. Rev. 34, 876 (1929)] discharge, which is characterized by cold ion temperature. This scenario is also known as the singular ion-source discharge. The H&T analytic result covers cases of ion sources proportional to exp() with the normalized plasma potential and =0,1,2 values, which correspond to particular physical scenarios. Many years following H&T's work, Bissell and Johnson (B&J) [Phys. Fluids 30, 779 (1987)] developed a model with the so-called warm ion-source temperature, i.e., regular ion source, under B&J's particular assumption that the ionization strength is proportional to the local electron density. However, it appears that B&J were not interested in determining the ionization length at all. The importance of this quantity to theoretical modeling was recognized by Riemann, who recently answered all the questions of the most advanced up-to-date plasma-sheath boundary theory with cold ions [K.-U. Riemann, Phys. Plasmas 13, 063508 (2006)] but still without the stiff warm ion-source case solution, which is highly resistant to solution via anz available analytic method. The present article is an extension of H&T's results obtained for a single point only withion source temperature Tn=0 to arbitrary finite ion source temperatures. The approach applied in this work is based on the method recently developed by Kos et al.	usa	American Institute of Physics	2009	1.01	Physics of plasmas	2.475	1.922
11223579	High-speed measurement of foot shape based on multiple-laser-plane triangulation	Optical three-dimensional shape measurement of live objects is becoming an important developing and research tool because of its nonintrusive nature and high measuring speed. The current methods are reaching truly high speed in one view configuration, but in the case of the entire object shape measurement, they are limited due to mutual interference between multiple measuring modules. The proposed method overcomes this limitation by using a laser multiple-line triangulation technique, where each of several measuring modules uses a unique laser wavelength. The measuring modules are positioned so that the entire surface of the foot is digitized. This prevents unwanted overlapping between adjacent light patterns. The calibration procedure for each measuring module and for the entire system is based on measurements of the surface of a reference object. The system parameters are determined using an iterative optimization algorithm. The precision of the system is better than 0.3 mm. The system is capable of measuring objects in motion. The results of the shape of a foot rising on its toes are given as an example.	int	Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers	2009	1.01	Optical engineering	0.553	1.506

11227670	Pitting formation due to surface and subsurface initiated fatigue crack growth in contacting mechanical elements	A computational model for simulation of surface and subsurface initiated fatigue crack growth due to contact loading is presented. The model is based on fracture mechanics theory where the required materials properties are obtained from common fatigue tests. For computational simulations an equivalent model of two contacting cylinders is used instead of simulating theactual contact of mechanical elements. The discretised model with the initial crack on or under the surface is then subjected to normal contact pressure, which takes into account the EHD-lubrication conditions, and tangential loading due to friction between contacting surfaces. The model considers also the moving contact of mechanical elements and for the surface initiated crack also the fluid trapped in the crack. The virtual crack extension method, implemented in the finite element method is then used for simulating the fatigue crack growth from the initial crack up to the formationof the surface pit. The numerical results correspond well with available experimental data. The described model can be used for simulation ofpitting phenomenon of contacting mechanical elements like gears, bearings, wheels, etc.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Wear	1.395	0.706

Four major xylanases were detected in the cell-associated fraction using the zymogram technique. The xylanolytic activity was inducible with the oat spelts xylan; two endoxylanases (51 and 145 kDa) were formed constitutively. The bulk of the xylanolytic activity was cell-bound and growth-phase dependent; the maximum activity in the cell-associated fraction was achieved after 16 h of incubation. The highest xylanolytic activity was determined in a medium with 0.54% oat spelts xylan. Under optimum conditions (the highest xylanases (51 and 58 kDa) were isolated by anion exchange chromatography on CIM DEAE 8 tubes attached to a MPLC system, and gel filtration.	cze	Springer	2001	1.01	Folia microbiologica	0.776	1.706
11237910	Aryl acrylate porous functional polymer supports from water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsions	Porous functional polymer supports are a class of material of wide interest due to the possibility of immobilising reactive species. A simplified procedure was applied for the preparation of porous polymer supports using a water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion. The primary emulsion was a high internal phase emulsion, having a volume fraction of water phase up to 95%. Two reactive acrylates, namely 4-nitrophenyl acrylate and 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl acrylate, were (separately) incorporated in the oil phase in order to obtain porous reactive polymer supports. Both acrylates were crosslinked with either divinylbenzene or ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and beads of size ca 60 m were obtained after the polymerisation of droplets suspended into the secondary aqueous phase. In the case of 4-nitrophenyl acrylate and divinylbenzene as a crosslinker, particles with a star shape, the core being ca 60 m in diameter and the arms ca 180 m in length, were obtained. The polymers were functionalised with morpholine, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine, piperidine or piperazine yielding supports with loadings of reactive groups of between 2.6 and 6.6 mmol g-1. The results show that multiple emulsions can be precursors for porous polymer preparation.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2007	1.01	Polymer international	1.557	1.528
11239963	The role of cryogenics in machining processes	The purpose of this work is to present some guidelines in the sustainable machining processes, using cryogenic conditions and gaining higher performances, lower environmental and health influences, increased safety, etc. The study presents the details about cryogenic fluids and their use in machining processes as an alternative to oil-based emulsions. The details of liquid nitrogen and the ways of their application in the machining processes, known as cryogenic machining process, are given. The research is upgraded with experimental case study on high temperature alloy machining - tungsten, and so presenting an important scientific and sustainability contribution in production processes. Experimental and analytical results are proving that the cryogenic machining technology has a high potential to cut costs and improve competitiveness, by reducing resource consumption and creating less waste and have less of an environmental and social impact, fulfilling the sustainability pillars: economical, social and environmental one, over conventional machining processes.	hrv	Strojarski fakultet;Elektrotehnièki fakultet;Graðevinski fakultet	2009	1.01	Tehnièki vjesnik	0.083	0.826
11240921	Chromosomes 7,17 polysomies and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor and p53 protein in epithelial hyperplastic laryngeal lesions	Purpose:To visualize directly a sequence of genetic changes underlying the entire spectrum of epithelial hyperplastic laryngeal lesions (EHLL) and laryngeal cancer by the use of non-isotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) for chromosomes 7 and 17 in correlation with overexpression of p53 protein and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The specific aim was to compare the results and prognostic significance between the two types of EHLL: isolated, mainly atypical hyperplasia or risky epithelium, and EHLL associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Patients and Methods: 59 tissue specimens of EHLL obtained from 34 patients, graded according to the Ljubljana classification into simple (SH), abnormal (AbH) and atypical hyperplasia (AtH), and carcinoma in situ (CIS) were included in the study. Non-fluorescentISH for chromosomes 7 and 17 was performed by biotinylated a-satellite DNA probes. Immunohistochemical staining for EGFR and p53 protein was analyzed on the same tissue samples. Results: Polysomy for both chromosomes increased in correlation with progressive grades of EHLL. The mostimportant finding was the statistically significant difference in chromosome copy numbers between the isolated AtH and AtH associated with SCC. Overexpression of EGFR and p53 protein was found in 61 (36/59) and 52% (31/59)of cases, respectively. The immunoreactivity for both markers increasedwith the grade of lesions, but the staining pattern was not so uniform in isolated EHLL. On the other hand, the immunoreactivity was expressed more constantly in EHLL adjacent to SCC. Conclusions: Numerical changes in chromosomes 7 and 17 might be associated with an upregulation of EGFR and p53 genes, and could contribute to critical events in laryngeal carcinogenesis.

The total numbers and proportions of xerotolerant and psychrophilic strains in comparison with mesophilic mycobiota were determined by using different enumeration, selective media and four isolation methods. The most extreme xerophilic fungi were taxonomically identified as belonging to the genera Eurotium and Aspergillus. The low water activity of the soil due to dry climate and frequent binding of water in ice crystals favors a high proportionof xerotolerant fungal species. The correlation between xerotolerantand psychrophilic fungi was observed.	nld	Elsevier	2000	1.01	FEMS microbiology letters	1.615	2.225

At first an example of a calculation of a thermal energy storage tank in an ice slurry system with a peak load demand is presented. Then a new concept of ice slurry storage without mixing is introduced. It leads to ice particle stratification and front propagation in the storage vessel. The stratification of ice particles in ice slurry is theoretically described by multi-component multi-phase fluid dynamics. The resulting stratification process is calculated and front propagation times are compared with experimental results; they compare fairly well.	gbr	Wiley-Interscience.	2008	1.01	International journal of energy research	1.016	0.803
11241945	Transient and permanent fusion of vesicles in Zea mays coleoptile protoplastsmeasured in the cell-attached configuration	Exocytosis in protoplasts from Zea mays L. coleoptiles was studied using patch-clamp techniques. Fusion of individual vesicles with the plasma membranewas monitored as a step increase of the membrane capacitance (Cm). Vesicle fusion was observed as (i) An irreversible step increase in Cm. (ii) Occasionally, irreversible Cm, steps were preceded by transient changes in Cm,suggesting that the electrical connection between the vesicle with the plasma membrane opens and closes reversibly before full connection is achieved. (iii) Most frequently, however, stepwise transient changes in Cm didnot lead to an irreversible Cm step. Within one patch of membrane capacitance steps due to transient and irreversible fusions were of similar amplitude. This suggests that the exocytosis events do not result from the fusion of vesicles with different sizes but are due to kinetically different states in a fusion process of the same vesicle type. The dwell time histogram of the transient fusion events peaked at about 100 msec. Fusion can be described with a circular three-state model for the fusion process of two fused states and one nonfused state. It predicts that energy input is requiredto drive the system into a prevailing direction.	usa	Springer	2000	1.01	The journal of membrane biology	2.973	2.347
11242011	Innovative ideas for future research on magnetocaloric technologies	Magnetic heating, refrigeration and energy conversion have caused awareness of being promising future environmentally benign technologies with much potential to enter some refrigeration markets. An increased research activitiy is observed, which to the end of the year 2010 lead to approximately forty-two prototypes. As most of these machines contain solid linear moving or rotating beds consisting of magnetocaloric material through static magnetic fields or moving magnets, which sweep a magnetic field over a static bed, all researchers face more or less the same problems. These concern materials, fluids, design and the operation characteristics. In this article innovative new system ideas are presented, which may have the potential to overcome existing barriers. The article is a proposal to the research community in the field of magnetocaloric technologies for future R&D activities. Taking into account all the limits and problems that researchers are tackling at present, the best chance to bring magnetocaloric technologies to the market is to try some substantially new approaches that go beyond the present state of the art.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2010	1.01	International journal of refrigeration	1.439	0.909
1124209	The enhancement of pipemidic acid permeation into the pig urinary bladder wall	The influence of interactions between polycarbophil and calcium on a model drug permeation into the pig urinary bladder wall was investigated. Pipemidic acid was used as a model drug. One percent wv polycarbophil dispersion significantly increases the permeation of pipemidic acid into the urinary bladder wall. The enhanced absorption of pipemidic acid caused by polycarbophil is significantly less pronounced in polycarbophil dispersions containing calcium. The enhancement of pipemidic acid permeation into the urinary bladder wall could be due to the opening of tight junctions, which causes higher paracellular permeability. In the case of polycarbophil dispersion with calcium some carboxylic groups of polymer are already occupiedwith calcium, present in the dispersions. As a consequence extracellular calcium binds to polycarbophil in lower extent if compared with polycarbophil dispersion without calcium and transport is increased to a lesser degree. We concluded that the mechanism of drug absorption enhancement caused by polycarbophil could be similar for urinary bladder as described in the literature for intestinal mucosa.	nld	Elsevier/North-Holland	2002	1.01	International journal of pharmaceutics	1.495	2.12
11242267	Magnetic power conversion with machines containing full or porous wheel heat exchangers	A first part of the article contains a thermodynamic theory describing the temperature distribution in a Curie wheel. The occurring nonlinear ordinary differential equation has an analytical solution. If a Curie wheel is stabilized by levitation, it is named Palmy wheel. These wheels show a full structure, and because of this reason, their uptake of heat from a flame (Curie wheel) or by (solar) light absorption (Palmy wheel) only on the periphery of a cylinder is very limited. To improve the method, a modificationof the principle by introducing a convective heat transport into aporous wheel is discussed. By this the power conversion rate from a heat fluxto mechanical and electric power is very much increased. The second part of the article presents results of a theoretical/numerical study on the efficiencies of magnetic power conversion plants operating with porous wheels. Furthermore, these efficiencies-which are promising-are compared with those of existing power conversion plants, as e.g. geothermal binary cycle power plants.	nld	North-Holland Publishing Co	2009	1.01	Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials	1.204	2.034
11242523	Application of magnetic refrigeration and its assessment	Magnetic refrigeration has the potential to replace conventional refrigeration-with often problematic refrigerants-in several niche markets or even some main markets of the refrigeration domain. Based on this insight, for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy a list of almost all existing refrigeration technologies was worked out. Then an evaluation how good magnetic refrigeration applies to each of these technologies was performed. For this purpose a calculation tool to determine the coefficient of performance (COP) and the exergy efficiency as a function of the magnetic field strength and the rotation frequencz of a rotarz-tzpe magnetic refrigerator was developed. The evaluation clearly shows that some application domains are more ideal for a replacement of conventional refrigerators by their magnetic counterparts than others. In the pre-study, four good examples were chosen for a more comprehensive investigation and working out of more detailed results. In this article, the calculation method is briefly described. COP values and exergy efficiencies of one very suitable technology, namely the magnetic household refrigerator, are presented for different operation conditions. Summariying, it is stated that magnetic refrigeration is a serious environmentally benign alternative to some conventional cooling, refrigeration and air-conditioning technologies.	nld	North-Holland Publishing Co	2009	1.01	Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials	1.204	2.034

The various influences and their physical background are explained by using a test-measurement setup, which makes it possible to investigate a specific influencing factor.

1125473	A procedure for estimating input energy spectra for seismic design	In this paper, the damage potential of an earthquake ground motion is evaluated in terms of the total power of the acceleration of the ground motion. By assuming an appropriate spectral shape for the input energy spectrum, and using the well-known Parseval theorem for evaluating the total power of a random signal, the peak amplification factor for the equivalent input energy velocity spectrum can be determined. It is shown that the peak amplification factor for the input energy spectrum depends on the peak-ground-acceleration to peak-ground-velocity ratio and duration of the strong motion phase of the ground motion. Values for the equivalent input energy velocity amplification factor vary from about 2 to 10 for most of the recorded ground motions used in this study. Although a considerable scatter of data is observed in this study, the peak amplification factor predicted by the Fourier amplitude spectrum of the ground acceleration provides a fairly good estimate of the mean value of the peak input energy compared to that determined from inelastic dynamic time history analyses, particularly for systems with high damping and low lateral strength. The peak amplification factor derived in this paper provides a more consistent approach for estmation of seismic demand when compared to an earlier empirical expression used for the formulation of duration-dependent inelastic seismic design spectra, even though only a slight difference in the required lateral strenght results from the use of the new formula	gbr	Taylor & Francis Group	2000	1.01	Journal of earthquake engineering	0.796	0.487
11256603	Modeling of a two-stage magnetic refrigerator with wavy-structure gadolinium heat exchangers	In a rotary magnetic refrigerator a porous ring is turning in and out of a magnetic field region. The adiabatic demagnetization of the magnetocaloric material produces the cold energy. This is described by a discontinuous temperature decrease, known as adiabatic temperature difference. For such a machine a physical model has been developed, based on a mapping of the magneto-thermodznamic problem. In this model, in a basic centre cell, two coupled linear partial differential equations are solved, which have been programmed in the Modelica language. The operation of a magnetic refrigerator is simulated with numerous parameters. Steady state solutions are obtained to verify the coefficient of performance under stable operation conditions. Optimal running conditions - defined by maximal values of the coefficient of performance - are not presented in this article, but can now easily be obtained with the existing program. A simple regulation strategy is proposed and implemented into the program.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2010	1.01	International journal of refrigeration	1.439	0.909
1125737	Design and test of a novel closed-loop system that exploits the nociceptive withdrawal reflex for swing-phase support of the hemiparetic gait	A novel closed-loop system for improving gait in hemiparetic patients by supporting the production of the swing phase using electrical stimulations evoking the nociceptive withdrawal reflex was designed. The system exploits the modular organization of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex and its stimulation site- and gait-phase modulation in order to evoke movements of thehip, knee, and ankle joints during the swing phase. A modified model-reference adaptive controller (MRAC) was designed to select the best stimulation parameters from a set of 12 combinations of four electrode locations on the sole of the foot and three different stimulation onset times between heel-off and toe-off. It was hypothesized that the MRAC system would result in a better walking pattern compared with an open-loop preprogrammed fixed pattern of stimulation (FPS) controller. Thirteen chronic or subacute hemiparetic subjects participated in a study to compare the performance of the two control schemes. Both control schemes resulted in a more functional gait compared to no stimulation (P <0.05) with a weighted joint angle peak change of 4.0 +- 1.6 (mean +- Standard deviation) degrees and 3.1 +- 1.4 degrees for the MRAC and FPS schemes, respectively. This indicates that the MRAC scheme performed better than the FPS scheme (P <0.001) in terms of reaching the control target.	usa	Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers	2011	1.01	IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering	2.278	2.012

1126536	Recombinant lamb chymosin as an alternative coagulating enzyme in cheese production	Recombinant lamb chymosin (RLC) was prepared and tested for its potential use in cheese production. The milk clotting activity and proteolytic activity of RLC were evaluated in comparison with commercial recombinant calf chymosin (RCC), cow rennet (CR), and microbial coagulant (MC). RLC, RCC and MC showed similar responses to pH, with a sharp increase of the coagulation time at pH 6.6. to 6.8 and decrease of curd firmness at the pH 6.5. to 6.6. In the case of CR, we observed two clear increases in the coagulation time and decreases in the curd firmness, at pH 6.4 to 6.5 and 6.6 to 6.8. Optimal clotting activity was obtained for RLC at 40oC, for both CR and RCC at 45oC, and for MC at 60oC. The temperature instability of RLC at temperature above 45oC could constitute a benefit in making hard cheese varieties. The addition of CaCl [down]2 to milk resulted in enhanced clotting activity of all coagulants, most prominently for CR. The proteolytic activity of RLC was significantly lower from that of CR but not significantly different from theactivity of RCC. The lower proteolytic activity in the cheese made with RLC did not have at least compaarable to that of cheese made with RCC, and both cheeses were better scored than the cheese made with CR.	usa	American Dairy Science Association;co-published by Elsevier since 2009-	2001	1.01	Journal of dairy science	1.691	0.672

Generally, this improves the efficiency of the RE-modelling process. In practice however,a significant number of points in the stage of the CAD model generation may become an issue. In addition, the 3D-digitization process is often connected with measuring errors because of the properties of measuring systems and/or the object. Therefore, nowadays considerable attention is devoted to the problem of pre-processing the results of 3D-digitization, often by means of tools of artificial intelligence.

Integral boundary equations are discretized using mixed boundary elements. The field function is interpolated using a continuous linear function while its derivative in a normal direction is interpolated using a discontiuous constant function over surface boundaey elements. Using amultidomain approach, also known as the subdomain technique, sparse system matrices similar to FEM are obtained. Interface boundary conditions between subdomains leads to an over-determined system matrix which is solved using a fast iterative linear least square solver. The accuracy and the robustness of the developed algorithm is presented on a scalar diffusion problem using simple cube geometry and various types of meshes.

Variations in tooth number and shape are rather uncommon in this species and factors determining roe deer dentition are considered to be quite stable. In both upper and lower jaws the first premolar is normally missing, but can be occasionally observed. To discover the frequency of P1 in the whole population, its occurrence was studied in the left hemi-mandibles of the totalone-year (2007) roe deer mortality in Slovenia, representing a large sample set of 41,895 individuals. The first premolar was detected in only 27 individuals (13 males, 12 females, 2 without data), indicating that its occurrence is very low and sporadic (0.6). Furthermore, the results of previous archaeozoological and embryological studies were analyzed. On the basis of observed facts, we conclude that the first mandibular premolars of roe deer belong to a category of tooth that has been suppressed in the evolution of the Cervidae.	ita	Mucchi Editore	2012	1.01	The Italian journal of zoology	0.939	1.303

Forty one (17.8%) tumors showed alterations in at least one marker. In further MSI analysis of these 41 MSI tumors with additional 9 markers, 21 tumors (9.6% of 230 analyzed) exhibited MSI at more than 40% and the rest 20 (8.7% of 230 analyzed) tumors exhibited MSI at 8%-20% tested markers. These results supportclassification of MSI tumors into high MSI tumors (more than 40% unstable loci) and low MSI tumors (less than 20% unstable loci). Based on our results the combination of BAT26 and two out of four other highly informative markers (D2S123, D5S346, BAT25 or BAT40) is recommended for rapid and reliableassessment of high MSI tumors.	deu	Springer-Verlag	2000	1.08	Pflügers Archiv	2.203	2.347

The TNF-alpha gene was fused with the A. niger glucoamylase GII form as a carrier-gene, behind its transcription control and secretion signal. The protein was expressed in the cells in the form of a glucoamylase-fusion protein, but was not present in the culture medium. From the expression of two hTNF-alpha analogues, LK 811 (Cys95/148) and LK 802 (Cys95/148, His107/108) respectively, we concluded that oligomerisation was not the critical point for secretion of hTNF-alpha in A. niger, but more probably improper folding already at the stage of monomer formation, or even incorrect processing of the molecule during the secretion pathway.	deu	Springer-Verlag	2000	1.08	Pflügers Archiv	2.203	2.347

In order to clarify the difference between the test temperature and real contact temperature, and to determine the effect of the real contact temperature for these reactions, we have calculated the contact temperatures using two well-known models and compare them with results of tribological experiments and some state-of-the-art analyses of wornsurfaces. The results suggest that the actual surface temperatures are 100-130 °C higher than the test temperatures. A contact temperature of about 250-260 °C was found to be the required key activation criterion for chemical reactions between the dialkyl dithiophosphate extreme-pressure (EP) additive and the DLC coating. Gradual formation of a tribochemical protective film from phosphates and organic sulphur/sulphates suggests a lower chemical reactivity and slower formation of the optimal tribochemical protective layer on DLC coatings than on steels. No tribological effect of anti-wear (AW)or EP additives could be found on the DLC coatings when the surface temperatures were below 120-140 °C. The temperature-induced graphitisation of the DLC that occurred in the contacts with the base oils, however, require about 250 °C of contact temperature. Lower surface temperatures or the use of additives suppressed this graphitisation.	che	Elsevier Sequoia	2010	1.01	Thin Solid Films	1.909	1.159
11274523	Monitoring laser cut quality using acoustic emission	The paper presents results of an analysis of acoustic-emission (AE) signals obtained during laser cutting of a steel plates, which are frequently used in the production of automotive body components. In the course of laser cutting, continuous signals, which are related to the quality achieved of the laser cut, are measured. After laser cutting characteristic AE bursts in the specimen material, which are results of a thermal influence, can be detected. The presence of dross is an important indicator of poor quality of laser cutting. The investigation on laser cutting was conducted on an unalloyed steel DC04 sheet and on austenitic stainless steel X5CrNi18-10 sheet of 1.5 mmin thickness. The same physical mechanism in the cut formation at both steels, however, resulted in a considerable different cut quality, which was indicated by the AE signals captured after the cutting process.	usa	Pergamon	2009	1.01	International journal of machine tools & manufacture	1.956	0.969
11275035	Determination of optimal cutting edge geometry on a stamped orthotropic circular electrical steel sheet	Today engineers involved in the stamping process used for high-volume production of rotor and stator laminations are faced with a great challenge to achieve extremely narrow dimensional and geometrical tolerance on their products. Because materials are produced by different suppliers, adjustments of technological parameters to the emerging differences are required to maintain the high quality of products. An upgraded engineering method was developed in which electrical steel sheet of semi-finish grade was not treated traditionally, but as a 3D body with orthotropic material behaviour. The round profile of the cutting edge was studied from the experimental and numerical point of view. If the completely round punch was used, the profile of the cutting edge appeared as a non-round shape. With additional FEM analyses a new profile of punch was designed as a non-round shape to be able to provide much better circularity. FEM simulation showed that 10 times lower profile deviations were found on the workpiece shaped by the new cutting element profile.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	1.567	1.019

The bacteriophages from both strains were examined by transmission electron microsopy and several morphologically different bacteriophages were observed, among others also a large virion with an icosahedral head with the diameter of ques of bacterial cells of the strain GA33 and has an approximately 800 nm long helical tail, which places it among the largest ruminal bacteriophages described to date. Other bacteriophages from the same indicator strain as well as from P. bryantii B[down]1 4 strain were smaller and tail structures were not observed in all of them.	cze	Springer	2001	1.01	Folia microbiologica	0.776	1.706
11276249	Molecular properties of central and peripheral histamine H1 and H2 receptors	We identified and characterised histamine H1 and H2 receptor subtypes on rat cortical astrocytes in primary culture with radioligand binding studies and compared their molecular properties with peripheral (bovine vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells) histamine H1 and H2 receptors. Our results showed the existence of a homogenous population of high affinity binding sitesfor 3H-mepyramine (Bmax= 281 fmol/mg protein, KD= 3.5 +/- 0.7 nM) and 3H-tiotidine (Bmax= 59 fmol/mg protein, KD 1.9 +/- 0.7 nM) on astrocytes, which was further confirmed by competition binding studies using various H1 and H2 specific agonists/antagonists. We showed differences in the density of receptors and differences in the affinities of competing drugs for the same histamine receptor subtype (H1 and H2) between the tissues used, which indicate different molecular properties of the central and peripheral histamine receptors.	deu	Slovenian Physiological Society	2000	1.08	Pflügers Archiv	2.203	2.347
11277273	The frequency dependence of phospholipid vesicle shapes in an external electric field	Experiments show that phospholipid vesicles exposed to AC electric field undergo a shape transition from prolate to oblate ellipsoidal shape when the frequency of the field is increased. A theoretical model, based on the minimization of total free energy of the vesicle, was devised to explain this phenomenon. The model exhibits the same frequency-dependent prolate-to-oblate shape transition as observed in the experiment.	deu	Springer-Verlag	2000	1.08	Pflügers Archiv	2.203	2.347
11277334	Adsorption of toxic organic compounds from water with hydrophobic silica aerogels	Silica monolith aerogels with different degrees of hydrophobicity were prepared by incorporating methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) or trimethylethoxysilane (TMES) in standard sol-gel synthesis followed by supercritical drying of gels with carbon dioxide (CO(2)) at 40 degrees C and 100 bar. The hydrophobicity of the aerogels was tested by measuring the contact angle (theta). The aerogels were also characterised by FTIR, DSC, and porosity measurements. Adsorption capacity measurements show that such modified hydrophobic silica aerogels are excellent adsorbents for different toxic organic compounds from water. In comparison to granulated active carbon (GAC) they exhibit capacities which are from 15 to 400 times higher for all tested compounds. Adsorption properties of hydrophobic silica aerogel remain stable even after 20 adsorption/desorption cycles.	nld	Academic Press	2007	1.01	Journal of colloid and interface science	2.309	2.506
1127816	Systematics and evolution of ruminal species of the genus Prevotella	Bacterial species of the genus Prevotella represent a numerically dominant microbial population in the rumen of cattle. They belong to the phylogenetic division Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) which is a large group of ecologically diverse bacteria with only a few shared traits. The phylogenetic descent from a common ancestor seems to be unquestionable, however, as judged from the small subunit ribosomal RNA analysis. Only 4 ruminal Prevotella species have been described to date, even though the sequence analysis of directly retrived 16S rRNA genes indicates a large genetic diversity within this group of rumen bacteria. The colsest relatives of ruminal Prevotella spp. are not surprisingly other species of the genus Prevotella, typically inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, oral activity and genital areas of other animals ans man. The previous phylogenetic analysis showed that species of the genus Prevotella can be split into two groups or superclusters, the ""ruminal"" and the ""non-ruminal prevotellas"". One of 4 currently described ruminal Prevotella spp., i. e. P. albensis, has been placed outside the supercluster containing ruminal Prevotella spp. and within the supercluster containing the non-ruminal Prevotellaspp. However, the number of available small subunitrRNA sequences from this species represents only a fraction of allknown ruminal Prevotella sequences.	cze	Springer	2001	1.01	Folia microbiologica	0.776	1.706
11278297	Lowering of the coronary flow in isolated rat heart by equinatoxin II depends upon extracellular Ca[sub]2+ concentration	Equinatoxin II (EqT II) is a basic polypeptide toxin from the sea anemone Actinia equina (L.). Its LD50 in mice is 33 g/kg. The cause of death after intravenous application has been attributed to the circulatory failure resulting in the cardiotoxic effects. In Langendorff's rat and guinea-pig heart preparations EqT II caused dose dependent decrease in the coronary flow (CF). Morphologic changes of different cell cultures incubated with EqT II arethe result of Ca2+ entry through the newly formed discrete pores. Pores in the cell membranes are composed of the toxin oligomeres. In the present study we tried to evaluate the dependence of vasoconstrictor effects of EqT II on isolated rat hearts upon the Ca2+ concentration in the perfusion solution. EqTII did not affect the CF in the group without Ca2+. The strongest effect was observed in the group with 1.5 mM Ca2+ where the CF decreased to 7.7+-7 %.The results of our experiments indicate that the effects of EqT II on CF depend on Ca2+ concentration in the extracellular solution.	deu	Slovenian Physiological Society	2000	1.08	Pflügers Archiv	2.203	2.347
1128072	Preliminary characterization of a tentatively novel rumen bacterial species from the genus Treponema	A new spirochetal strain was isolated from the rumen of a black-and-white Holstein cow and preliminarily characterized. The sugar fermentation tests and morphological observations indicated this organism to be a member of a novel, as yet underscribed spirochetal rumen species. The small subunit ribosomal RNA were amplified and the PCR products were cut with the restriction endonucleases TaqI, DdeI, HhaI and Sau3AI. The comparison of the observed RFLP with the hypothetical fragment lengths of the computer analyzed 16S rRNA sequences from the type strains of the ruminal spirochetes Treponema bryantii and T. saccharophilum confirmed the tentative novel identification. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the bacterium has the typical spirochetal structures, i. e. the other sheath, the protoplasmic cylinder and the axial filament (it is not yet clear how many flagella compose the filament). An additional extracellular structure was observed which appeared as an exocytoplasmic polar flagellum, approximately 2 [micron]m long and protruding from one tip of the cell. The average size of the cells was 0.5 x 10-15 [mikron]m and the wavelengths and the amplitudes of the primary coils were 2.9 and 1.3 [mikron]m, respectively.	cze	Springer	2001	1.01	Folia microbiologica	0.776	1.706
11281174	Methodology for determination of anaerobic digestion kinetics using a bench top digester	This paper presents a methodology for determining the microbial growth kinetics of an ideal anaerobic process in a non-ideal laboratory anaerobic digester (Armfield). Some laboratory experiments were performed, to confirm the proposed methodology. Having the same zero biomass concentration, some process parameters were changed and their influence on substrate outlet concentration was monitored. The specific growth rate of the biomass, the saturation constant of the substrate, and the yield coefficient were calculated, on the basis of the measured values. These parameters enabled us to perform a dynamic simulation of an anaerobic process in ideal continuously-stirred tank reactors (CSTR). The results represented the mass concentration profiles for substrate and biomass, from which the time required for reaching the steady state (60 d), where the operation is optimal, could be determined. The laboratory anaerobic digester provided operational process data, which are applicable for wastewater treatment plant design purposes.	nld	Elsevier;Pergamon	2007	1.01	Resources, conservation and recycling	1.270	1.376

A genomic library was constructed and screened with oligonucleotide DNA probe specific for 16S rRNA gene of P. bryantii. Five out of six different copies of 16S RNA gene were recovered and sequenced. Only minor differences (0.3-1.2%) between copies were detected within the 1541 bp long sequence. The impact of the sequence variability of 16S rRNA gene copies on phylogenetic positioning of P. brayantii was determined. All five sequences form cloned P. brayantii [down]1 4 16S rRNA genes were placed in the same operational taxonomy unit. Control regions of all five analyzed rRNA operons were almost identical and three candidate for promoter sequences were identified by Neutral Network Promoter Prediciton.

1128540	Isolation and quantification of triterpenoid acids from Ganoderma applanatum of Istrian origin	Various Ganoderma ssp. have been known for their wide range of pharmacologically active compounds. From Ganoderma applanatum of Istrian origin, growing on Populus, triterpenoid acids were isolated and quantified. An in-house relational system was built and used as a support for isolation and identification of triterpenoids from different layers of G. applanatum fruiting bodies. An optimised extraction procedure was developed, and IR, UV and NMR spectra were used for the identification of ganoderic and ganoderenic acids. The highest fraction of triterpenoid acids was found in the tubes (6.4 mg/g of air-dry weight), followed by the dark context layer, which is the young part of the pileus (2.5 mg/g). The white context layer of the older pileus and the upper surface of the fruiting body contained only about 0.6 mg/g of triterpenoid acids.	hrv	Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology	2000	1.01	Food technology and biotechnology	0.291	0.734

The creening was performed with the SOS/umu test and we monitored the ability of extracts to inhibit UV induced expression of umuC gene in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Seventeen extracts inhibited umuC exoressionby more than 50%. These extracts were further evaluated for the ability to inhibit UV induced mutations in Escherichia coli WP@. Five extracts ( Cortinarius evernius, Rozites caperatus, LActarius vellereus, Russula integra and Pleurotus cornucopiae) inhibited also Uv induced mutations. The study showed that certain mushrooms contain substances with bio-antimutahenic potential. Particularly interesting for further investigation are Pleurotus cornucopiae (Lentinaceae), which was the most effective and species of Russulaceae and Cortinaceae families, which might contain common family specific bio-antimutagenic substance(s).	deu	Verlag Volk und Gesundheit	2002	1.01	Pharmazie	0.740	1.557
1128817	Mucoadhesion on pig vesical mucosa: influence of polycarbophil/calcium interactions	The influence of polycarbophil/calcium interactions on the mucoadhesive properties of polycarbophil has been examined. Polycarbophil dispersions and films with different concentrations of calcium or sodium ions were prepared and the following parameters were measured: detachment force on pig vesical mucosa, zeta potential, pH and viscosity. Polycarbophil detachment force decreased significantly in the presence of calcium but not sodium. Both ions decrease the pH of polycarbophil dispersions. On the other hand, altering the pH of hydrated polycarbophil films in the absence of added ions had an insignificant effect on detachment force. Both ions reduce the absolute valuesof polycarbophil zeta potential, calcium more efficiently than sodium. We could conclude that decreased mucoadhesion strength of polycarbophil in thepresence of calcium is due to the chelation of polycarbophil carboxylic groups by calcium and crosslinking of polymer. The crosslinked polymer chains would be expected to be less flexible, and therefore, interpenetrate to a lesser extent with the glycosaminoglycans of mucus. Additionally, the interactions between functional groups of polycarbophil and mucus glycosaminoglycans are lowered due to the calcium, blocking the carboxylic groups. The mechanism of calcium influence on viscosity of polycarbophil dispersions appears to be different: repulsion between ionised carboxylic groups of polycarbophil prevails over the crosslinking of polycarbophil by calcium.	nld	Elsevier/North-Holland	2002	1.01	International journal of pharmaceutics	1.495	2.12

This study was aimed to assess the feasibility of extracting chlorophylls fromstinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) by solvent extraction. In preliminary, the investigation concerned three parts of raw material (leaves, stalk and whole plant), different preservation techniques (blanching and drying) and different storage temperatures of preserved material ( |20 C for blanched and 4 C for dried sample). Extracts were analysed for chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B, respectively, by means of HPLC method. Afterwards, optimizationof single-step conventional extraction was carried out by examining the influence of the following process parameters on the extraction yield and isolation efficiency of chlorophylls: type of organic solvent, content of water in ethanol/water mixtures, ratio solvent/material, temperature, time of extraction and pH of the extraction mixture. Furthermore,to improve the yield and/or the selectivity of the extraction, multi-step conventional extraction experiments as well as other solid ]liquid extraction techniques (soxhlet and ultra-sound assisted) were performed and compared. c 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1129073	Investigation of polymeric nanoparticles as carriers of enalaprilat for oral administration	Enalaprilat is a typical angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and is very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to design and characterize poly-(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanoparticles containing enalaprilat and to evaluate the potential of these colloidal carriers for the transport of drugs through the intestinal mucosa. Nanoparticle dispersions were prepared by the emulsification-diffusion method and characterized according to particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and physical stability. Effective permeabilities through rat jejunum of enalaprilat in solution and in enalaprilat-loaded nanoparticles were compared using side-by-side diffusion chambers. The solubility of enalaprilat is very low in many acceptable organicsolvents, but in benzyl alcohol is sufficient to enable the production of nanoparticles by the emulsification-diffusion process. The diameters of drug-loaded PMMA and PLGA nanoparticles were 297 and 204 nm, respectively. Theconcentration of the stabilizer polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in dispersion has an influence on particle size but not on drug entrapment. The type of polymer has a decisive influence on drug content--7 and 13% for PMMA and PLGA nanoparticles, respectively. In vitro release studies show a biphasic release of enalaprilat from nanoparticle dispersions--fast in the first step and very slow in the second. The apparent permeability coefficient across rat jejunum of enalaprilat entrapped in PLGA nanoparticles is not significantly improved compared with enalaprilat in solution.	nld	Elsevier/North-Holland	2002	1.01	International journal of pharmaceutics	1.495	2.12
11292699	Influence of the graphite absorber during laser surface hardening	The paper presents the results of the research of a laser surface hardening process applied to the C45E steel with graphite absorber coating on specimen surfaces. The evaluation of the laser surface hardening process was performed by measuring the IR radiation from the interaction spot. The results confirmeda strong correlation between the IR radiation voltage signal and the dimensions of microstructural changes occuring in the laser surface hardening steel. Changes of the absorbing coating thickness produced changes of the absorptivity of the laser beam, which was confirmed by measurements of the depth and width of hardened traces. For laser surface hardening the optimum coating thickness of a graphite absorber was determined. A factorial analysis and a method of orthogonal polynomials were used to determine response surfaces for the voltage signal of IR radiation the depth and width of the hardened trace achieved. Absorptivity difference between various graphite absorber coating thicknesses was evaluated based on the Ashby-Shercliff model.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2010	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.466	0.909

These groups are not depend on the specific pair of manifolds, but rather depend only on the square ?$F$? of the fundamental groups which arise after cutting the manifold ?$Y$? along the submanifold ?$X$?. In the present paper we introduce the groups ?$LS_\ast(F)$? for an arbitrary morphism ?$F$? of quadratic extensions of antistructures. The introduced groups are a natural generalization of the usual groups ?$LS_\ast$? in the case of the one-sided submanifold. The introduced groups have the same algebraic properties and coincide with the geometric groups ?$LS_\ast$? when the morphism ?$F$? is given by the square of group rings over ?$\ZZ$? obtained from the square of fundamental groups.	rus	Consultants Bureau	2001	1.01	Mathematical notes	0.157	0.48

11296027	A single-stage centripetal pump - design features and an investigation of the operating characteristics	In this paper, we present an experimental and numerical investigation of a single-stage centripetal pump (SSCP). This SSCP is designed to operate in the pump regime, while forcing the working media through impeller-stator flow channels in the radial inward direction. The measured performance curves are characterized by a hysteresis, since the throttle-closing performance curves do not correspond to the throttle-opening performance curves throughout the whole operating range. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to establish these throttle-closing and throttle-opening performancecurves. The flow conditions obtained with the CFD simulations confirm that the hydraulic behavior of the SSCP is influenced by the partial circumferential stall that occurs in the impeller-stator flow channels. It wasshown that the inflow conditions to the impeller-stator assembly considerably influence the flow rate of the stall cessation, the size of the hysteresis, and the head generated during part-load operations.	usa	American Society of Mechanical Engineers	2010	1.01	Journal of fluids engineering	0.440	0.909

In this article we propose a new method inspired by a multi-agent based system that was initially used for classification and attribute selection in microarray analysis. Best classifying gene subset selection is a common problem in the field of bioinformatics. If we regard the software metrics measurement values of a software module as a genome of that module, and the real world dynamic characteristic of that module as its phenotype (i.e. failures as disease symptoms) we can borrow the established bioinformatics methods in the manner first to predict the module behavior and second to data mine the relations between metrics and failures.	svn	World Scientific	2007	1.01	International journal of software engineering and knowledge engineering	0.239	0.927
11299355	Transitioning to sustainable production	This paper presents a case-study that highlights the importance of sustainable machining technologies in achieving sustainable development objectives. A technology evaluation was undertaken to understand the likely impacts of the use of technology on sustainability performance measures. The evaluation is more than an experimental method for supporting the design of technology and an instrument for supporting decision-making. It is also a toolfor supporting technology policy and for encouraging its adoption and application in industry. More specifically, a sustainability evaluation of cryogenic and high pressure jet-assisted machining in comparison to conventional machining is examined. Sustainability performance measures refer to environmental impact, energy consumption, safety, personal health, waste management, and cost. The case-study refers to the machining of high-temperature Ni-alloz (Inconel 718). It is shown that tooling costs represent the major contribution to the overall production cost, which contradicts previous analzses, and that sustainable machining alternatives offer a cost-effective route to improving economic, environmental, and social performance in comparison to conventional machining.	gbr	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Journal of cleaner production	2.425	1.886
11299606	Morphology of solidified polysulfone structures obtained by wet phase separation	Evidence is presented that all three theoretically predicted modes of phase separation take place in the ternary system polysulfone(PSf)/N,N-dimethyl acetamide(DMA)/water during the process of wet phase separation (WPS). The elementary process of solidification is reconsidered with regard to the (non-)equilibrium phase separation. Cast solutions with more than 15 wt% of PSf undergo nucleation and growth of the polymer lean phase with formation of separation membranes characterised by a cellular structure. When cast solutions with about 5-7 wt% of PSf undergo WPS, somewhere inside the ternary system conditions are established so that alongside other solidified PSf structures the bicontinuous spinodal structures superimposed by bead-like structures are also formed. Variety of lacy PSf structures with less/more polymer beads is the manifestation of the primary phase separation by the spinodal mode superimposed by the secondary phase separation taking place by heterogeneous nucleation and growth of the polymer rich phase mode. Latex formation during the WPS will also be explained. Skin formation on the cast solution - coagulation bath interface by direct accumulation of polymer is established regardless of the PSf content in the cast solution.	nld	Pergamon Press	2007	1.01	European Polymer Journal	2.248	1.528
11300569	Predictive characteristics of users of alternative medicine	Background: The use of alternative medicine has become an important factor in health care delivery. Objectives: To evaluate patient characteristics, morbidity, functional status, quality of life, satisfaction with care, practice characteristics and health care utilisation in general practice patients using alternative medicine. Design: Cross-sectional survey of GP patients completing a self-administered questionnaire. Setting: A stratified sample of 36 GP offices in Slovenia. Main output data: Patients' age, sex, educational status, residence, presence of chronic condition, incidence of anxiety or depressive symptoms, incidence of patient-expressed need for emergency care in one year, data on self-care, data on functional status, quality of life, satisfaction with care, incidence of use of out- of-hours services and specialist or hospital services in users versus non-users. Results: 115/1753 patients (6.6%) reported visits to alternative practitionersin 1997. Users of alternative medicine were from midlife age groups; were more likely to have a chronic condition, had a lower perception of life quality and a higher incidence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, andhad had more need for emergency treatment. They are heavier users of primary as well as secondary care services; they have changed their GP recently but are not significantly dissatisfied with their current regular GP.Conclusions: Use of alternative medicine appears to be characteristic of patients with a more active approach to managing their problems. GPs should enquire about the use of alternative medicine by their patients, especially those more likely to seek such help. Raising the question of alternative medicine will improve doctor-patient communication and help to resolve underlying health problems.	che	Schwabe und Co	2000	1.01	Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift	0.258	1.695

11302166	Fractional calculus applied to the analysis of spectral electrical conductivity of clay-water system	The analysis of the low-frequency conductivity spectra of the clay-water mixtures is presented. The frequency dependence of the conductivity is shown to follow the power-law with the exponent n = 0.67 before reaching the frequency-independent part. When scaled with the value of the frequency-independent part of the spectrum the conductivity spectra for samples at different water content values are shown to fit to a single master curve. It is argued that the observed conductivity dispersion is a consequence of the anomalously diffusing ions in the clay-water system. The fractional Langevin equation is then used to describe the stochastic dynamics of the single ion. The results indicate that the experimentally observed dielectric properties originate in anomalous ion transport in clay-water system characterized with time-dependent diffusion coefficient.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Journal of contaminant hydrology	1.852	1.063

The purpose of our study was to compare ultrasound voiding cystography (USVC) for the detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) inchildren with direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC). Ninety-nine children, aged 1.1-12.3 years, with 198 potentially refluxing units, were investigated simultaneously by DRVC and USVC. The indications for cystography were urinary tract infection, follow-up of a previously detected VUR, and screening of siblings of children with VUR. During the investigation an echo-enhancing agent (Levovist) was administered intravesically through a catheter already in place for the DRVC. The movement of both agents, radiotracer and Levovist, was registered simultaneously by a computerized gamma camera and US, respectively. The results were analyzed with DRVC representing the reference diagnostic test. The overall sensitivity and specificity of USVC for the detection of VUR were 79% and 92%, respectively. USVC may represent a reliable diagnostic tool for the detection and follow- upof VUR in children.	deu	Springer-Verlag New York;Springer	2000	1.01	Pediatric nephrology	1.370	1.024
11302873	Trypsin level in gallbladder bile and ductitis and width of the cystic duct	Background/Aims: The change from laparotomy to laparoscopy for cholecystectomyhas raised the question of how to manage concomitant bile duct stones. The present-day interest - and controversy - has focused on a transcystic approach reported to be feasible in 66-96% of cases, but without explaining the necessary prerequisite: the widening of the cystic duct. The cystic duct, wide mainly in patients with bile duct stones, has been reported to be highly variable: from strictured to very wide. The present study aims atcomparing the trypsin level in the gallbladder bile and the cystic duct morphology and width in patients with and without bile duct stones. Methodology: A prospective series of 63 gallstone patients, 30 with and 33 without bile duct stones (controls), underwent cholecystectomy and bile duct clearance. The study includes the trypsin level in the gallbladder bile, the width and morphology of the cystic duct, and the size of the gallstones. Results: The patients with bile duct stones had, in contrast to the controls, higher trypsin levels in the gallbladder bile (P<0.001) and wider cystic ducts(P<0.001) with more pronounced signs of chronic ductitis. Conclusions: The obtained results strongly suggest that the increased trypsin level, a signof reflux of pancreatic juice, caused changes in the cystic duct that facilitate gallstone migration, which also ought to render a transcystic stoneextraction feasible.	grc	Thieme	2000	1.01	Hepato-gastroenterology	0.905	1.146

We performed measurements on induction surface-hardened specimens, the thickness of hardened layers being different in each case. A change in the microstructure of the hardened surfacelazer produces changes in specific electric conductivity $sigma$ and relative permeability $mu_{rm r}$. The two parameters and chosen analyzing frequencies influence the depth sensing of micromagnetic changes. The most commonly chosen characteristic of Barkhausen noise is the ${rm V}^{2}_{rm RMS}$ value of a captured signal.

1130710	Forest biomonitoring of the largest Slovene thermal power plant with respect to reduction of air pollution	The condition of the forest ecosystem in the vicinity of the largest Slovene power plant [the otanj Thermal Power Plant (TPP)] was monitored during the period 1991-2008 by determining the total concentration of sulphur, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll in Norway spruce needles. After 1995, the introduction ofcleaning devices at the TPP dramatically reduced the former extremely high SO2 and dust emissions. The most significant findings of this comprehensive, long-duration survey are as follows: (1) the chosen parameters are suitable bioindicators of stress caused by air pollution in Norway spruce needles; theyreflect both spatial and temporal variations in air pollution as well as the degree of efficiency of the cleaning devices; (2) observations show that the physiological condition of Norway spruce in northern Slovenia has significantly improved since 1995, when the first desulphurization device at TPP was built, together with a reduction in the area influenced by pollution from TPP; (3) metabolic processes in spruce needles react to air pollution according to the severity of the pollution and the length of exposure; exposure to high SO2 ambient levels and/or spread over a long duration can damage the antioxidant defence mechanisms of spruce trees as well as diminishing the concentration of ascorbic acid; (4) a reduction in the exposure to air pollution improves the vitality of the trees (e.g. higher concentrations of total (a+b) chlorophyll), as well as restoring their defence capabilities as shown by higher concentrations of ascorbic acid; and (5) forest monitoring should be continued and focused on integrating the effects of multiple stressors, which can additionally affect a forest ecosystem.	nld	Reidel	2012	1.01	Environmental monitoring and assessment	1.400	1.997
11312918	Modelling of fastener flexibility in CFRP strengthened timber-framed walls using modified [gamma]-method	The paper provides semi-analytical modelling for prefabricated timber-framed walls using the modified ?$/gamma$?-method. The walls are composed of a timber frame and gypsum plasterboards (GPB) which are flexibly connected to the timber frame. Because the tensile strength of the GPB is approximately 10-times lower than the compressive one, it is convenient to strengthen the boards in their tensile diagonal direction with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips, which are glued to the boards. Additionally, in the proposed mathematical model the classical beam theory is used taking into account a fasteners' flexibility in the timber frame - GPB connecting area, as well as crack appearing in the GPB and an influence of the inserted CFRP strips. Therefore the CFRP strip contribution is considered with a modified slip modulus which results in the fictive increased stiffness coefficient of the fasteners.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2008	1.01	Engineering structures	1.102	0.815
11316507	Towards the effective tool wear control in micro-EDM milling	The electrode wear in micro-electrical discharge milling (micro-EDM milling) is one of the main problems to be solved in order to improve machining accuracy. This paper presents an investigation on wear and material removal inmicro-EDM milling for selected process parameter combinations typical of rough and finish machining of micro-features in steel. The experiments were performed on state-of-the-art micro-EDM equipment. Based on discharge countingand volume measurements, electrode wear per discharge and material removal per discharge were measured for several energy levels. The influence of the accuracy of volume measurements on the electrode wear per discharge and on the material removal per discharge are discussed, and the issues limiting the applicability of real time wear sensing in micro-EDM milling are presented.	gbr	IFS Publications	2010	1.01	International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	1.068	1.019
11323158	Time and space-efficient architecture for a corpus-based text-to-speech synthesis system	This paper proposes a time and space-efficient architecture for a text-to-speech synthesis system (TTS). The proposed architecture can be efficiently used in those applications with unlimited domain, requiring multilingual or polyglot functionality. The integration of a queuing mechanism, heterogeneous graphs and finite-state machines gives a powerful, reliable and easily maintainable architecture for the TTS system. Flexible and language-independent framework efficiently integrates all those algorithms used within the scope of the TTS system. Heterogeneous relation graphs are used for linguistic information representation and feature construction. Finite-state machines are used for time and space-efficient representation of language resources, for time and space-efficient lookup processes, and the separation of language-dependent resources from a language-independent TTS engine. Its queuing mechanism consists of several dequeue data structures and is responsible for the activation of all those TTS engine modules having to process the input text. In the proposed architecture, all modules use the same data structure for gathering linguistic information about input text. All input and output formats are compatible, the structure is modular and interchangeable, it is easily maintainable and object oriented. The proposed archi-tecture was successfully used when implementing the Slovenian PLA TTOS corpus-based TTS system, as pre sen ted in this paper.	nld	North-Holland	2007	1.01	Speech communication	0.690	1.012

11336982	Prediction of stress relaxation of fabrics with increased elasticity	The present study investigated stress relaxation in fabrics with increased elasticity. For prediction of the degree of stress relaxation the frequently used mechanical models reported in the literature were analyzed. The mechanical models which were used in this paper were: Maxwellæs model, the two-component Maxwellæs model, the modified model of standard linear solid, Alfreyæs model and the three-component Maxwellæs model with nonlinear spring for explaining the 1 hour relaxation curve and the 24 hour relaxation curve. The results of the study show that it is hard to precisely predict the value of stress after 24 hours using the model that was built up based on the 1 hourexperimental curve. When comparing the experimental relaxation curve with the fitted curve from the mechanical model it is clear that the models with higher component values explain the experimental relaxation curve better. The weak point of those models was the high number of local minima which makes it difficult to find the global minimum.	usa	Sage Publications	2006	1.01	Textile research journal	0.578	0.597
1133704	The effect of different quantities and compositions of pelleted diets of immune response of mares during the production of anti-tatanus sera	Research was carried out into the effect that different quantities and compositions of concentrated portions of meal had on certain haematological properties and on the immune response of mares in the course of hyper-immune antitetanus sera production. The experiment involved 24 Nonius and Lipizzaner cros-bred mares divided into two groups of 12 animals each, a control group and a trial group. The experiment lasted 12 months, with haemoatological and immunoloical tesets being carried out every 30 days. During the course of the experiment each mare was subjected to 11 immunisation cycles, and in that period no mare fell ill. Leukocyte and haematocrit counts revealed no differences between the control and the test groups throughout the entire duration of the experiment. Following the second immunisation cycle the leukocyte count increased in both groups of mares, remaining significantly hiher than the normal physiological value in horses throughout the experiment.The concentrated portion of meal, differing both in quality and quantity, had no influence on leucocyte count and haematocrit level in the mares throughout the experiment. However, the immunodiffusion titre in the test group did show a slightly higher value of ID-titre than in the control group, indicating that the quantitatively and qalitatitively differing portions of meal had a more positive effect on immune response and anti-tetanus anti-bodytitre in the test group than it did in the control group.	deu	Paul Parey	2001	1.01	Berliner und Münchener Tierärztliche Wochenschrift	0.530	0.603
11337494	The effect of small flaws on the fatigue strength of HAZ at the weld toe	The effects of small artificial surface flaws on the fatigue strength of HAZ material are studied. The samples of coarse grain HAZ material were prepared using a welding thermal-cycle simulator. The artificial flaws were produced byindenting with a Vickers pyramid at different loads as either single indentations or as a series. The size of the flaws did not exceed the primary austenitic grain size of the material, which is the most relevant microstructural unit of carbon steels. The dependence of the experimentally determined bending fatigue strength of treated coarse grain HAZ materials on the properly evaluated size of the artificial flaws was compared with the law of long-crack propagation. The biggest flaws evaluated with the flaw-size parameter ?area ? 100 m are still small for the studied coarse grain HAZ. In further experimental work, the effects of flaw size and the effects of residual stresses should be analysed separately.	che	Inderscience Enterprises	2007	1.01	International journal of materials & product technology	0.203	1.682
11338262	Application of HPLC with electrochemical detection for the determination of low levels of antioxidants	This article presents a newly developed method for the determination of low levels of antioxidants, present in meat and meat products. The method is a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using coulometric electrochemical detector. An oil soluble antioxidant, carnosic acid, extractedfrom rosemary was used as a target compound.. Usual dosage of carnosic acid as an antioxidant in meat and meat products is 0.0040% (40 mg/kg), calculated on fat content. The ability to accurately measure low levels of antioxidants in food would be of great advantage to the food industry, because it would improve the process of partitioning of antioxidantsin to food system, which would lead to improved food stability and better prediction of its shelf life. The selectivity and sensitivity of the coulometric array are the key properties that were required for the analysis presented in this article. A coulometric technique is well suited for the determination of low levels of analyte and is one of the most sensitive analytical approaches available today.	nld	Academic Press	2007	1.01	Journal of food composition and analysis	2.106	1.15

11339542	A multilevel MINLP methodology for the approximate stochastic synthesis of flexible chemical processes	This work present a methodology for the optimal design and MINLP synthesis of flexible chemical processes with known probability distributions of uncertain parameters. This methodology comprises synthesis at 1) non-flexible nominallevel, 2) flexible nominal level, and 3) approximate stochastic flexible level. The first level is concerned with modelling challanges od lsarge process flow sheets, sensitivity analyses and studies of uncertsain parameters. This level ususally results in non-flexible design. Second and third levels take into account flexibility requirements by adding critical points into the model. Both flexible levels rely on considerable reduction of discrete points. Lower levels provide good starting structures for higher levels, therefore, the computational effort is reduced and larger problems with many uncertain parameters, e.g. 10 to 100, can be solved. The use of this methodology is illustrated by the synthesis of a flexiblw heat-integrated methanol process flow sheet.	rou	Syscom 18.	2007	1.01	Revista de chimie	0.261	1.015
11344089	Cells producting cathepsins D, B, and L in human breast carcinoma and their association with prognosis	Lysosomal proteinases, cathepsins D, B, and L have been associated with malignant tumor progression and with prognosis in various human carcinomas. Inthe current study, the immunohistochemical localization of cathepsins in tumor cells was correlated with cathepsin protein concentration in breast carcinoma cytosols from 77 patients. Significant correlation was found for cathepsin D (P <.041) and borderline correlation for cathepsin B (P < .055) but not for cathepsin L. We hypothesize that the poor correlation of cysteine cathepsins was attributable to the fact that they were present not only in malignant epithelial cells, but also in infiltrating macrophages and stromal fibroblasts. In addition, tumor-surrounding myoepithelial cells (42% of tumors) and myofibroblasts (26% of tumors) as well as endothelial cells of neovasculature (10% of tumors) all stained specifically for cathepsin B. Two thirds of tumors co- expressed cathepsins B and L in tumor cells, whereas only17% of tumors co- expressed all 3 cathepsins. Intense immunostaining for cathepsin B of tumor cells was observed in tumors at high TNM stage and tumorshaving positive lymph nodes. The expression of cathepsin B was independent of established prognostic factors, whereas intense cathepsin L staining in tumor cells was associated with high histological grade. With respect to prognosis of patient survival, only tumorcell-associated cathepsin D (P = .042) and myoepithelial cellassociated cathepsin B (P= .061) showed borderline significance. Cathepsins B and L immunostaining in tumor cells was not prognostic. In contrast, cytosolic levels of cathepsin B correlated with higher rate of relapse. Taken together, these results show the diversity in the cellular distribution of cathepsins in human breast carcinoma, presumably reflecting specific regulation and function of each of the cathepsins during tumor progression.	usa	W.

11348246	Influence of biodiesel fuel on the combustion and emission formation in a direct injection (DI) Diesel engine	This paper studies the influence of biodiesel fuel on the combustion and emission formation of two different direct-injected diesel engines, both employing different combustion processes. The research was focused on determining the influence of the specific combustion process on measurement results to ascertain if a generalization of the results is possible or whetherthey have to be interpreted as specific for specific engines. Standard D2 diesel fuel and commercial 100% biodiesel fuel were used. Tests were executed using both fuels under the same conditions, and exhaust emissions andengine performance were measured and compared. In-cylinder pressure was also acquired, and the rate of heat release curves were computed by means of azero-dimensional, one-zone combustion model. Some macroparameters of the combustion process were obtained from the heat-release-rate curves. The results obtained for both engines showed that findings regarding the influenceof biodiesel fuel on the combustion process and emission formation could not be generalized and had to be interpreted as specific for the particular engine.	usa	The Society	2007	1.01	Energy & fuels	1.679	1.015

Scanning distance and scanning angle of impact laser beam was found to be the most crucial interaction between the surface topology and scanning process. Therefore, we focused these two parameters while other parameters like microstructure, colour of surface, optical settings remained fixed. Despite of random nature of freeform surfaces, the measurements were systematic, according to the principles of thedesign of experiment (DOE) adjusting angle and distance in the whole scanning range.

11350294	The impact of structure on the undrained shear strength of cohesive soils	The relationship between the undrained shear strength and the water content ofcohesive soils can be described with a two parameter non-linear function. Parameter a is the water content at the undrained shear strength su=1 kPa, andb is the slope of the linear function which represents the ratio between the water content logarithm and the undrained shear strength logarithm. These parameters depend mainly on the type and amount of clay minerals in the soils,the particle sizes and shapes, their arrangements, the forces between the clay particles, and the chemical composition of the pore water. The impactof quantity, type and size of clay grains on the water content at a uniform undrained shear strength in different soils has been studied previously, whilst the impact of structure is less understood. Particle associations and arrangements (i.e. fabric), and the interparticle forces determine the structure of soil. This paper focuses on an investigation of therelationship between water content and undrained shear strength in kaolinite samples with different structures. The various arrangements of clay particles that resulted from the changed of interparticle forces were obtainedby salt addition (NaCl). Microfabrics of wet kaolinite samples were studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope. The results showed that clay structure exerts a strong influence on the relationship between the quantity of water and undrained shear strength. This was reflectedin the values of both soil-dependent parameters, a and b. Values of parameter a varied between 39.16% and 62.96%, and b between 0.100 and 0.139, for well crystallized kaolinite with salt concentrations of 0- 175 mmol/l. Forpoorly crystallized kaolinite with salt concentrations of 0-300 mmol/l, thevalues of a range between 46.96% and 100.30%, and b between 0.090% and 0.148%.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Engineering geology	0.951	0.763

11365977	On 2-groups with submultiplicative spectrum	A group ?${\cal G}$? of complex square invertible matrices is said to have submultiplicative spectrum if for any ?$G, H$? in ?${\cal G}$? we have that ?$\sigma(GH) \subset \sigma(G)\sigma(H)$?, where ?$\sigma(G)$? denotes the spectrum of ?$G$?. The question whether such a group can be irreducible arises in the study of the structure of matrix semigroups and is answered in the positive for groups with odd exponent (cf. Radjavi and Rosenthal, Simultaneous Triangularization, Springer, New York, 1999). Here we consider the most important remaining case, namely 2-groups with submultiplicative spectrum. If there is an element in the group of the kind whose determinant has order equal to either the exponent or half of the exponent of the group, then the group is reducible. We give an example of an irreducible group of the kind such that the order of determinant of every element equals one quarter of the exponent of the group.	nld	North-Holland	2002	1.01	Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra	0.400	0.504

A comparison of electrical thresholds for biomechanical responsein the ankle and for evoked electromyographic signals from specific leg muscles during intraoperative extradural direct stimulation of roots L4, L5, and S1. Objective. To determine whether a biomechanical response in the ankle to direct root stimulation occurs before evoked electromyographic signals and to determine differences in electrical excitability of the roots circumferentially. Summary of Background Data. Stimulus intensities of 1.2 - 5.7 mA are reported to evoke electromyographic response in corresponding muscles to direct stimulation of normal roots. Stimulus intensities of 6-8 mA were suggested to detect bony pedicular compromise by stimulation of a hole ora screw during pedicle instrumentation. Electrical thresholds of three-dimensional torque response in the ankle to direct root stimulation havenot yet been evaluated and compared with thresholds of evoked electromyogram. Methods. Direct monopolar stimulation of the surgically exposed roots L4, L5, and S1 was performed from different sites around the root by a cuff multielectrode. Biomechanical response was measured as an isometric torque in the ankle at each of three orthogonal axes. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from rootspecific muscles were detected by a pair of surface or wire electrodes. Results: Mean threshold for biomechanical response in the ankle to stimulation of roots L4, L5, and S1 was 0.72 +- 0.39 mA and for CMAP response was 1.09 mA +- 0.36 (N = 13). Thresholds for biomechanical responses were significantly lower than for CMAP responses (P = 0.0004; paired t test). Nerve roots were electrically most excitable on their ventral aspects. Conclusion.

11377881	Fiber types in the mouse levator auris longus muscle	The histochemical composition of the levator auris longus (LAL) muscle has been investigated in adult NMRi mice. Histochemical reaction for myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) after preincubation in alkaline and acidic media, nicotine amideadenine-dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH-dehydrogenase), and alphaglycerophosphate dehydrogenase were performed on cryosections of LAL muscle. Expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms was detected with theimmunoperoxidase method applying monoclonal antibodies against MyHC isoforms - 1, -2a, -2x/d, and -2b, as well as by sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) glycerol gel electrophoresis. The muscle was proven to be a pure fast-twitch muscle. The most numerous fibers in LAL muscles contained MyHC-2b and some MyHC-2a. Histochemically, pure IIA fibers with oxidative metabolism and pure IIB fibers with glycolytic metabolism were detected. In contrast to the majority of mature control muscles, numerous hybrid fibers coexpressing MyHC-2x/d with MyHC-2a or MyHC-2b were present. Both hybrids were oxidativeglycolytic; additionally, some hybrids containing MyHC-2a were oxidative. In one out of six muscles, traces of MyHC-1 were detected both withimmunoperoxidase staining and with SDS glycerol gel electrophoresis. Rare fibers that exceptionally expressed small amounts of MyHC-1 always coexpressedMyHC-2a, which is an additional proof that pure type I fibers do not exist in LAL. Due to these histochemical characteristics and to its previously described morphological features, the use of the LAL muscle as a model for various studies, particularly muscle and nerve interactions, is emphasized.	usa	Liss	2000	1.01	Journal of neuroscience research	3.207	2.536
11378137	Variation and trends in incidence of childhood diabetes in Europe	Background. To study the epidemiology of childhood-onset type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes in Europe, the EURODIAB collaborative group established in 1988 prospective geographically-defined registers of new cases diagnosed under 15 years of age. This report is based on 16 362 cases registered during the period 1989-94 by 44 centres representing most European countries and Israel and covering a population of about 28 million children. Methods. Multiple sources of ascertainment were used in most centres to validate the compieteness of registration by the capture-recapture method. Trends in incidence during the period were analysed by Poisson regression, thedata from centres within each country being pooled. Findings. The standardised average annual incidence rate during the period 1989-94 ranged from 3,2 cases per 100 000 per year in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to 40.2 cases per 100 000 per year in two regions of Finland. By pooling over all centres, the annual rate of increase in incidence was 3.4% (95% CI 2.5-4.4%), but in some central European countries it was more rapid than this.

The results confirm a very wide range of incidence rates within Europe and show that the increase in incidence during the period varied from country to country. The rapid rate of increase in children aged under 5 years is of particular concern.	gbr	Lancet Publishing Group	2000	1.01	The Lancet	10.232	1.695
11381849	On stability of invariant subspaces of commuting matrices	We study the stability of (joint) invariant subspaces of a finite set of commuting matrices. We generalize some of the results of Gohberg, Lancaster, and Rodman for the single matrix case. For sets of two or more commuting matrices we exhibit some phenomena different from the single matrix case. We show that each root subspace is a stable invariant subspace, that each invariant subspace of a root subspace of a nonderogatory eigenvalue is stable, and that, even in the deragotory case, the eigenspace is stable if it is one-dimensional. We prove that a pair of commuting matrices has only finitely many stable invariant subspaces. At the end, we discuss the stability of invariant subspaces of an algebraic multiparameter eigenvalue problem.	usa	North Holland	2002	1.01	Linear Algebra and its Applications	0.462	0.679

A linear mapping ?$\Phi: \cal{C}(X) \to \cal{C}(Y)$? is called ?$\varepsilon$?-disjointness preserving, if ?$fg=0$?, implies that ?$\|\Phi(f) \Phi(g)\| \le \varepsilon \|f\| \|g\|$?. If ?$\Phi: \cal{C}(X) \to \cal{C}(Y)$? is a continuous or surjective ?$\varepsilon$?-disjointness preserving linear mapping, we prove that there exist a disjoinness preserving linear mapping ?$\Psi: \cal{C}(X) \to \cal{C}(Y)$? satisfying ?$\|\Phi(f) - \Psi(f)\| \le 20 \sqrt{\varepsilon} \|f\|$?. We also prove that the every unbounded ?$\varepsilon$?-disjointness preserving linear functional on ?$\cal{C}(X)$? is disjointness preserving.	usa	American Mathematical Society	2002	1.01	Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society	0.334	0.504
11384347	Metal-doped (Ti, WC) diamond-like-carbon coatings: Reactions with extreme-pressure oil additives under tribological and static conditions	In contrast to non-doped diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings, reliable chemical evidence of the reactions between metal-doped DLC coatings and oil additives under tribological conditions using state-of-the-art surface-sensitive chemical analyses is still scarce. In this study we have investigated the reactivity of metal-doped (Ti, WC) DLC coatings with the extreme-pressure (EP) dialkyl dithiophosphate additive - without the presence of a steel counter body in the contact that befogs the actual coating reactions. Static ""reactivity"" experiments without any tribological or mechanical effects were also performed to provide a further insight into the lubrication mechanisms. The results confirmed the chemical reactions between the EP additive and all the DLC coatings, as well as their oxidation during the tribological contacts. We measured an about 10-times higher chemical activitz (a 25-fold P/S ratio increase) for the Ti-doped DLC compared to the WC-doped or non-doped DLC, which also agrees with it having the lowest amount of wear in this study. We suggest that the Ti-DLC boundary lubrication is achieved via binding sites at the O vacancies present in the Ti-doped DLC coating. The data also clearly show, in contrast to most of literature reports, that even though small, some direct chemical activity between the W-DLC and the dialkyl dithiophosphate EP additive is also possible without any iron catalytic effect. However, the chemical changes were significantly smaller, also allowing coating graphitization, which might be one of the reasons for the 50% higher wear of the WC-doped compared to the Ti-doped DLC.	che	Elsevier Sequoia	2010	1.01	Thin Solid Films	1.909	1.159
11385366	Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition of an inflected language using stems and endings	In this article, we focus on creating a large vocabulary speech recognition system for the Slovenian language. Currently, state-of-theart recognition systems are able to use vocabularies with sizes of 20,000 to 100,000 words. These systems have mostly been developed for English, which belongs to a group of uninflectional languages. Slovenian, as a Slavic language, belongs to a group of inflectional languages. Its rich morphology presents a major problem in large vocabulary speech recognition. Compared to English, the Slovenian language requires a vocabulary approximately 10 times greater for the same degree of text coverage. Consequently, the difference in vocabulary size causes a high degree of OOV (out-of-vocabulary words). Therefore OOV words have a direct impact on recognizer efficiency. The characteristics of inflectional languages have been considered when developing a new search algorithm with a method for restricting the correct order of sub-word units, and to use separate language models based on sub-words. This search algorithm combines the properties of sub-word-based models (reduced OOV) and word-based models (the length of context). The algorithm also enables better search-spacelimitation for sub-word models. Using sub-word models, we increase recognizer accuracy and achieve a comparable search space to that of a standard word-based recognizer. Our methods were evaluated in experiments on a SNABI speech database.	nld	North-Holland	2007	1.01	Speech communication	0.690	1.012
11385622	A comprehensive noise robust speech parameterization algorithm using wavelet packet decomposition-based denoising and speech feature representation techniques	This paper concerns the problem of automatic speech recognition in noise-intense and adverse environments. The main goal of the proposed work is the definition, implementation, and evaluation of a novel noise robust speech signal parameterization algorithm. The proposed procedure is based on time-frequency speech signal representation using wavelet packet decomposition. A new modified soft thresholding algorithm based on time-frequency adaptive threshold determination was developed to efficiently reduce the level of additive noise in the input noisy speech signal. A two-stage Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based classifier was developed to perform speech/nonspeech as well as voiced/unvoiced classification. The adaptive topology of the wavelet packet decomposition tree based on voiced/unvoiced detection was introduced to separately analyze voiced and unvoiced segments of the speech signal. The main feature vector consists of a combination of log-root compressed wavelet packet parameters, and autoregressive parameters. The final output feature vector is produced using a two-staged feature vector postprocessing procedure. In the experimental framework, the noisy speech databases Aurora 2 and Aurora 3 were applied together with corresponding standardized acoustical model training/testing procedures. The automatic speech recognition performance achieved using the proposed noise robust speech parameterization procedure was compared to the standardized mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction procedures ETSI ES 201 108 and ETSI ES 202 050.	egy	Hindawi Publishing Corporation	2007	1.01	EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing	0.619	0.927
1138569	Effect of oxalic, acetic acid, and ammonia on leaching of Cr and Cu from preserved wood	Wood treated with CCB (chromated copper borate) has an expected service life of 20-50 years, depending on conditions of service and method of treatment. After this period, treated wood is discarded as special waste. Due to toxic elements (Cu, Cr, and B) in such treated wood, burning and landfill disposal are not considered as environmentally sound solutions. Chemical extraction seems more promising. The principle of the method is to convert fixed biocides in wood into soluble form and leach them out of the wood. In order to elucidate this process, copper(II) sulfate, potassium dichromate, and CCB-treated samples were leached using five different agents, namely, water, an aqueous solution of oxalic or acetic acid, and an aqueous solution of oxalic or acetic acid with ammonia. Afterwards, the amounts of leached copper and chromium were determined. In a parallel experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of wet- and dry-leached and unleached samples were performed in order to determine the paramagnetic complexes that were formed. The highest chromium leaching was achieved with the aqueous solution of oxalic acid, as chromium was converted into water-soluble chromium oxalate. While the mixture of oxalic acid and ammonia resulted in the highest copper leaching, EPR observation revealed that in this case water-soluble complexes of copper, oxalic acid, and ammonia were formed. We found out that oxalates formation is not the only mechanism responsible for copper or chromium leaching. High acidity may play an important role too.	deu	Springer	2004	1.01	Wood Science and Technology	0.803	0.492
11386907	Method for modifying axial fan's guard grill and its impact on operating characteristics	This paper presents the impact of guard grill on aerodynamic integral characteristic, the spectrum of sound pressure level and total sound power level at four characteristic operating points of axial fans with standard guard grill, with optimized guard grill and without guard grill. The study of guard grills impact was conducted with measurements at integral level and local outflow velocity field of the axial fan without guard grill. The measurement results of the local outflow velocity field of the axial fan without guard grill at optimal operating point were used to model the optimized guard grill contour. The guard grill of axial fan has a significant impact on aerodynamic integral characteristic at free flow and mostly used operating region. The influence of guard grill is also characteristically reflected in the spectrum of sound pressure level via vortex shedding frequency and consequently at total sound power level of compared axial fans.	deu	VDI-Verlag GmbH	2010	1.01	Forschung im Ingenieurwesen	0.348	0.826
1138793	Variable structure pantograph mechanism with spring suspension system for comprehensive upper-limb haptic movement training	Numerous haptic devices have been developed for upper-limb neurorehabilitation, but their widespread use has been largely impeded because of complexity and cost. Here, we describe a variable structure pantograph mechanism combined with a spring suspension system that produces a versatile rehabilitation robot, called Universal Haptic Pantograph, for movement training of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The variable structure is a 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanism composed of 7 joints, 11 joint axes, and 3 configurable joint locks that reduce the number of system DOFs to between 0 and 3. The resulting device has eight operational modes: Arm, Wrist, ISO (isometric) 1, ISO 2, Reach, Lift 1, Lift 2, and Steer. The combination of available work spaces (reachable areas) shows a high suitability for movement training of most upper-limb activities of daily living. The mechanism, driven by series elastic actuators, performs similarly in all operational modes, with a single control scheme and set of gains. Thus, a single device with minimal setup changes can be used to treat a variety of upper-limb impairments that commonly afflict veterans with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or other direct trauma to the arm. With appropriately selected design parameters, the developed multimode haptic device significantly reduces the costs of robotic hardware for full-arm rehabilitation while performing similarly to that of single-mode haptic devices. We conducted case studies with three patients with stroke who underwent clinical training using the developed mechanism in Arm, Wrist, and/or Reach operational modes. We assessed outcomes using Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment and Wolf Motor Function Test scores showing that upper-limb ability improved significantly following training sessions.	usa	Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, Dept. of Veterans Affairs	2011	1.01	Journal of rehabilitation research and development	1.779	1.201
11388699	Effect of different production phases on residual stress field in double-layer cast rolls	The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of different production operations and parameters on residual stress level in double-layer cast rolls. Using a hole-drilling method, residual stress depth distribution in surface layer was measured around and along the body of the double-layer cast roll after casting, heat treatment, turning and grinding. Furthermore, using different turning and grinding parameters (speed, feed), and heat treatment parameters (temperature, time), influence of these parameters on residual stress level and distribution was determined. Results of the investigation show that the conditions in the casting pit have an influence onthe residual stress field generated in double-layer cast rolls, with surfaces exposed to faster cooling rates in general showing higher residual stress values. Very critical phase in rolls production is coarse grinding, which if not carried out properly will generate very high tensile stresses in the roll surface and cause surface cracking or even roll fracture. Heat treatment on the other hand results in uniform compressive residual stress field in the roll's surface. However, reduction in tempering time and especially increase in hardening temperature lead to increased residual stresslevel in the roll surface. Final machining of the roll surface further influences residual stress level in the roll. Increase in turning speed of up to 40% results in compressive residual stress increase of up to 60%, while less than 30% increase in feeding rate gives almost 100% increase in residual stress level.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	1.567	1.019
1139081	Model for classifying wood products according to environment burdening during the process of manufacturing	Orientation towards environment-friendly production and such products as will be acceptable for the environment, in addition to the existing economic criteria, has become a necessity and one of the very important strategic goals of wood industry. In the article is described the model for classifying wood products according to their environment burdening during the manufacturing process. The aim of the model generation was to include the most important criteria of environment burdening appearing in wood industry and on the basis of these criteria to calculate the uniform estimate of environment burdening. With a generated mathematical model we gradually proceed from the entry criteria to the final estimate of environment burdening of a specific product, which enables us not only to calculate the final estimate but also to analyse and to present the differences among products at all levels of the decision tree.	svk	Alfa	2003	1.01	Drevársky výskum	0.091	0.437

Particle identification provides clear D[sup]0, D[sup]+, (D[sub]s)[sup]+ and ([Lambda][sub]c)[sup]+ signatures. The charm hadron production rate is measured in each channel by a fit to the scaled energy, impact parameter information and the invariant mass spectrum. Two measurements of R[sub]c are presented, from the D[sup]*+ production rate and from the overall charm counting, including strange charm baryon production, in cc[bar] events. The multiplicity n[sub]c, which includes hidden cc[bar] and strange charm baryon production, is inferred from the charm counting in bb[bar] events. The final results are R[sub]c = 0.1665 [plus minus] 0.0095 and n[sub]c = 1.166 [plus minus] 0.086.	deu	Springer	2000	1.01	The European physical journal	5.408	1.99

11393558	New approach to uncertainty evaluation in the calibration of gauge block comparators	Gauge blocks (GBs) are being calibrated by two methods: interferometric calibration and calibration by mechanical comparison to reference GB. While interferometric method represents primary level, comparison is more suitable for calibrating industrial GBs because of lower costs and shorter calibration time. Although no significant changes in equipment happened in last decade, improvements in mechanical comparison are on-going. In addition to the uncertainty of the reference GB calibration, uncertainty of the GB comparator is the most important contribution to total uncertainty of the mechanical calibration. The article introduces a new approach for evaluating the uncertainty of GB comparator calibration. The uncertainty budget and results of analytical and experimental evaluation of all contributions are presented. This approach results in lower end-effect uncertainty and a slightly higher length dependent uncertainty, in comparison with the uncertainty evaluation procedure as described in EA document EA-10/02.	nld	Elsevier	2007	1.01	Measurement	0.500	0.771

The sample consists of 550 boys aged 10, 12 and 14. A battery of 26 tests was used for measuring motor abilities. The structure of motor abilities was established with the use of the factor analysis. The results show the emergence of significant qualitative changes of motor dimensions. Half of the motor factors change with age, while the rest of them remain stable. The motor dimensions, which are under the influence of regulation mechanisms of a higher order, change with age. In contrast to that, most motor dimensions which are dependent on mechanisms of a lower order are developmentally more stable. With the progression of age the structure of motor dimensions becomes increasingly well-defined. Observations of this study show that qualitative changes of motor dimensions are closely connected with the development processes	hrv	Institute for Anthropological Research, University of Zagreb	2001	1.01	Collegium antropologicum	0.414	0.649
11399958	A preliminary study on various implementation approaches of domain-specific language	Various implementation approaches for developing a domain-specific language are available in literature. There are certain common beliefs about the advantages/disadvantages of these approaches. However, it is hard to be objective and speak in favor of a particular one, since these implementation approaches are normally compared over diverse application domains. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical results from ten diverse implementation approaches for domain-specific languages, but conducted using the same representative language. Comparison shows that these discussed approaches differ in terms of the effort need to implement them, however, the effort needed by a programmer to implement a domain-specific language should not be the only factor taken into consideration. Another important factor is the effort needed by an end-user to rapidly write correct programs using the produced domain-specific language. Therefore, this paper also provides empirical results on end-user productivity, which is measured as the lines of code needed to express a domain-specific program, similarity to the original notation, and how error-reporting and debugging are supported in a given implementation.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2008	1.01	Information and software technology	1.200	1.281
11402267	Influence of flow field on sedimentation efficiency in a circular settling tank with peripheral inflow and central effluent	The paper presents an experimental study of suspension flow patterns and velocity field inside a circular settling tank with continuous operation. Research was focused on the impact of a specific flow pattern on the sedimentation efficiency of the prototype settling tank. The latter differed from a common circular settling tank in that it was peripherally fed and had the central draw-off. Experiment was carried out on a settling tank section made of plexiglass and represented a radial slice of a prototype settling tank. The flow field and local suspension concentration was determined by computer-aided visualization. Sedimentation efficiency was assessed relatively by comparison of the amount of settled particles (sludge height measurements) between different types of flow in a certain time period of the settling tank operation. Results showed that there were two types of flow in the settling tank that were initiated by a horizontal or vertical inflow from the distribution ring. The type of inflow (horizontal or vertical) was a function of the suspension height in the settling tank. Significant differences in sedimentation efficiency were observed between both types of flow, particularly at lower inlet suspension concentrations. Horizontal inflow proved to be less efficient in terms of settling.	che	Elsevier Sequoia	2010	1.01	Chemical engineering and processing	1.729	1.428
11403016	Mitochondria regulate the amplitude of simple and complex calcium oscillations	In a mathematical model for simple calcium oscillations [Biophys. Chem. 71 (1998) 125], it has been shown that mitochondria play an important role in the maintenance of constant amplitudes of cytosolic ?$Ca^2+$? oscillations. Simple plausible rate laws for ?$Ca^2+$? fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane have been used in this model. Here we show that it is possible to use the same rate laws as a plug-in element in other existing mathematical models and obtain the same effect on amplitude regulation. This result appears to be universal, independent of the type of model and the type of ?$Ca^2+$? oscillations. We demonstrate this on two models for spiking ?$Ca^2+$? oscillations [J. Biol.

The main challenge in the design of a practical quasi-distributed sensor array proved to be in mitigation of otherwise pronounced cross-talk effects among the individual sensors in the network. Thecross-talk effects originate from mode filtering properties and the strong mode excitation dependence on the multimode refractometer sensors that constitute the array. The introduction of mode conditioning based on fiber mode filters and mode mixers effectively reduced the cross talk to a negligible level while providing the desired sensor response at acceptable collateral losses to the network. A comprehensive experimental analysis was carried out to provide detailed insight into the multimode sensor array behavior and to obtain data necessary for an overall and effective network design.	usa	Optical Society of America	2007	1.01	Applied optics	1.701	1.124

11412569	The direct expansion of graphs	The concept of exapsion of a graph has proved to be an efficient tool in the study of median, quasi-median and partial Hamming graphs. The basic idea of expansion is that given a graph ?$G$?, we obtain a graph ?$G'$? by enlarging a subgraph ?$G$? according to a certain rule in such a way that ?$G'$? inherits certain properties of ?$G$?.

I.-Wissenschaftsverlag, Manhaim, 1990, p.p. 459-477). In particular he pointed out the case when a direct product in the process of expansion is used, and called it a relational expansion.

Often the transmitters are laid out like vertices of a triangular lattice in the plane. We investigate the corresponding colouring problem of assigning sets of colours of size ?$p(v)$? to each vertex of the triangular lattice so that the sets of colours assigned to adjacent vertices are disjoint. A ?$n-[p]$?colouring of a graph ?$G$? is a mapping ?$c$? from ?$V(G)$? into the set of the subset ?$1,2,...n$? such that ?$|c(v)=p(v)$? and for any adjacent vertices ?$u$? and ?$v$?, ?$c(u) \cap c(v) = \emptyset$?. We give here an alternative proof of the fact that every triangular-free induced subgraph of the triangular lattice is 5-[2]colourable. This proof yields a distributed algorithm that finds a 5-[2]colouring of such a graph. We then give a distributed algorithm that finds a ?$[p]$?coloration of a triangle-free induced subgraph of a triangular lattice with a most ?$\frac{5\omega_p(G)}{4} + 3$? colours.	nld	North-Holland	2002	1.01	Discrete Mathematics	0.395	0.504

Reconstruction of action graphs from smaller ones is considered, some results on lifting and projecting the equivariant group of automorphisms are proved, and a special case of the split-extension structure of lifted groups is studied. Action digraphs in connection with group presentations are also discussed.	nld	North-Holland	2002	1.01	Discrete Mathematics	0.395	0.504

11417561	Is Sjögren's syndrome involved in the formation of localized nodular amyloidosis?	Oobjective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that, with the use of preoperative treatment, the dimensions of the upper part of the oral cavity of an infant with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) become more similar to those of a noncleft infant. Design: This was a retrospective study of upper dental casts taken at birth and prior to lip repair at 6 monthsof age. A treated group, an untreated group, and a group of noncleft contemporaries were compared cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Models wereanalyzed by the trigonometric method. Setting: The study was performed at a maxillofacial center servicing a population of two million. Participants: The treated group consisted of 24 babies born after 1990 with UCLP that started presurgical treatment within 20 days of life. The untreated group consisted of 25 randomly selected UCLP casts taken at birth and 25 casts takenjust before lip surgery. The noncleft group consisted of 25 full-term infants whose mothers participated in the longitudinal growth study. All participants belonged to the same ethnic group. Iinterventions: Presurgical treatment consisted of the babies constantly wearing a thin, passive acrylic plate mimicking the normal palate and a slim adhesive tape fixed to the lip segments to bring them slightly together. Results: The upper oral cavity in a newborn with UCLP was significantly larger than in a noncleft infant, the onlyexception being in the sagittal dimension. After presurgical treatment, the upper oral cavity was remodeled and slightly enlarged; there was a lesser difference from the noncleft at 6 months than at birth. The cleft in the alveolus reduced significantly, and the position of the incisive point improved. The group without presurgical treatment had no remodeling, and the growth dynamics were similar to the noncleft so that the dimensional differences from the normal remained the same as the birth.

11418457	Unique square property and fundamental factorizations of graph bundles	Graph bundles generalize the notion of covering graphs and graphs products. Authors W. Imrich, T. Pisanski and J. erovnik constructed an algorithm that finds a presentation as a nontrivial cartesian graph bundles over triangle-free simple base using the relation ?$\delta^\ast$? having the square property. An equivalence relation ?$R$? on the edge set of a graph has the (unique) square property if and only if any pair of adjacent edges which belong to distinct ?$R$?-equivalence classes span exactly one induced 4-cycle (with opposite edges in the same ?$R$?-equivalence class). In this paper we define the unique square property and show that any weakly 2-convex equivalence relation possessing the unique square property determines the fundamental factorization of a graph as a nontrivial cartesian graph bundles over an arbitrary base graph, whenever it separates degenerate and nondegenerate edges of the factorization.	nld	North-Holland	2002	1.01	Discrete Mathematics	0.395	0.504
11418902	Specification and verification of a parametric handover procedure using TLA	In mobile systems, some nodes link dynamically through different channels at different times. The $?pi?$-calculus is a popular process algebra for specification and verification of systems with dynamic linking and synchronous, rendezvous message passing communication of component processes. Dynamic linking can be elegantly specified in it by sending channels to be used for further communication as messages. However, in order to be able to use the $?pi?$-calculus, one has to learn its process-algebraic concepts and laws. On the other hand, specification and verification in the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) is almost entirely based on ordinary mathematics (i.e., first-order predicate logic, set theory, etc.). Therefore, this paper proposes a TLA approach to the specification and verification of systems with synchronous communication and dynamic linking similar to the $?pi?$-calculus one. It is presented with help of a TLA specification and verification of a parametric mobile network handover procedure which has previously been specified with the ?$pi$?-calculus. In fact, TLA + is used as the specification language, thus achieving completely formal specifications.	usa	World Scientific	2006	1.01	Journal of circuits, systems, and computers	0.116	0.946
11419675	Effect of pitting corrosion on fatigue performance of shot-peened aluminium alloy 7075-T651	Pitting corrosion has a major influence on aging of structural elements made of high-strength aluminium alloys as corrosion pits lead to earlier fatigue crack initiation under tensile dynamic loading. A cause of fatigue crack initiation in a corrosive medium is a stress concentration at a corroded area.In order to improve material resistance to corrosion fatigue it is necessary to reduce pit-tip stresses. To eliminate or reduce pit stresses, cold surface hardening by shot peening was proposed. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of surface hardening by shot peening on electrochemical stabilitz and corrosion fatigue properties of high-strength aluminium alloy 7075-T651 in the corrosive environment of a chloride solution. The results obtained show a favourable influence of shot-peening treatment on corrosion fatigue properties. Induced compressive residual stresses in the surface layer retard the initiation of fatigue cracks, and so the fatigue life improvement of structural elements made of high-strength aluminium alloys was observed.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Journal of materials processing technology	1.567	1.019

The seeds were extracted with water, methanol, 35% acetone and 60% ethanol at room (TR) and at boiling (TB) temperature of solvent.Extracts were analyzed for the contents of caffeine and catechins, epicatechin (EC), catechin (C) and epicatechin gallate (ECG), by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of total phenols (according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure) and proanthocyanidins were analysed by UV spectrophotometry. The guarana seed water extract obtained at room temperature contained higher amounts of caffeine and catechins than did alcoholic guarana seed extracts. The antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities of guarana seed extracts were evaluated using the ß-carotene-linoleic acid emulsion system and the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH ). All tested guarana seed extracts displayed strong antioxidant and radical-scavenging properties. The guarana seed extracts were tested against three food-borne fungi: Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride and Penicillium cyclopium, and three health-damaging bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus cereus by theagar well diffusion and broth dilution assay. The alcoholic guarana seed extracts displayed stronger antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms than did water extracts. Results presented here may suggest that seed extracts of guarana possess strong antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, and they can therefore be used as a natural additive in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.	nld	Applied Science Publishers	2007	1.01	Food chemistry	3.052	1.15
11423254	In-line short cavity Fabry-Perot strain sensor for quasi distributed measurement utilizing standard OTDR	This paper presents an in-line, short cavity Fabry-Perot fiber optic strain sensor. A short air cavity inside a single-mode fiber is created by the fusionsplicing of appropriately micro machined fiber tips. A precise tuning of the cavity length is introduced and used for the setting of the sensor static characteristics within the quasi-linear range around a quadrature point, which significantly simplifies signal processing. Sensor insertion losses achieved by short cavity design and optimized fusion splicing pro ved to be below l dB. Low insertion los s allows for effective cascading of the proposed strain sensors into a quasi-distributed sensor array. A practical IO-point quasi-distributed strain sensor array was demonstrated in practice, where each in-line sensor was tuned to the same operating point in the static characteristics, thus allowing for simple interrogation of the sensor array by using standard telecommunication OTDR. In addition, precise tuning of the short cavity Fabry Perot sensor was applied for an effective compensation of temperature-induced strain errors and for an increase in the unambiguous measuring range, while improving the overalllinearity of the sensor system.	usa	Optical Society of America	2007	1.01	Optics express	3.709	1.124
11430408	Bifurcation analysis of calcium oscillations	The behavior of calcium oscillation near bifurcations is analyzed for three different models. For the model developed by Somogyi and Stucki [42], it is shown that the range of oscillations is bounded by supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations. Near the latter, canard orbits arise, that is, quasi-harmonic oscillations with a very small amplitude grow very fast to become pulsed oscillations. The potential biological significance of this behavior is discused. A time-scale analysis of this model is performed and an approximation formula for the oscillations period is derived. For two models that we presented earlier [30, 31], it is shown that a homoclinic bifurcation and an infinite period bifurcation, respectively, occur. These imply that the oscillation period can reach arbitrarily high values. This behavior is discussed in the light of frequency encoding, and the scaling laws of the oscillation period are given	sgp	World Scientific	2001	1.01	Journal of biological systems	0.306	0.619

The efficiencies of the new vertex chain codes are then compared theoretically and practically against the most popular chain codes.

The proposed analytical method is generally applicable and features highly accurate corrected fuel consumption results. It enables calculation of the corrected fuel consumption out of a single fuel consumption test run in a single analytic post-processing step. An additional fuel consumption test run might be needed to obtain highly accurate results if ratio of the energy content deviation of the electric storage devices to the energy used for vehicle propulsion over the test cycle is high. Proposed method enables consideration of non-linear energy flow changes and non-linear HEV component efficiency changes caused by the energy management strategy or by the component characteristics. The method therefore features highly accurate results out of the minimum number of fuel consumption test runs and thus optimizes workload for development or optimization of HEVs. The input data of the method are characteristic energy flows and efficiencies that are derived from the energy flows on selected energy paths of HEVs.	gbr	Applied Science Publ.	2010	1.01	Applied energy	3.888	1.428
11451419	Yield-point phenomenon in constitutive models of cyclic plasticity	This paper describes the yield-point phenomenon in rate-independent constitutive models of cyclic plasticity. This phenomenon is typical of annealed low-alloy steels and related alloys as well as of some aluminium and titanium alloys and occurs at first transition from the elastic into the elasto-plastic region. The effects of cyclic plasticity are described with constitutive equations of kinematic and cyclic hardening or softening. The advantage of the presented model is that it requires a small number of material parameters which describe the yield-point phenomenon and can be defined using simple uniaxial monotonous experiments. In order to define material parameters and establish the stress-strain response of the constitutive model in comparison with the actual state, uniaxial monotonous and uniaxial cyclic tension-compression experiments were carried out. The model is included in the finite element code the use of which helps to simulate the contribution of the model to the development of the stress-strainstate in a real structure.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Computational materials science	1.458	2.13

11461977	Functional identities revised: the fractional and the strong degree	The concept of the fractional and the strong degree of an element in a ring are introduced. It is shown that definitive results on functional identities can be obtained in rings which contain elements of appropriate fractional (or strong) degree. This enables us to extend the result on functional identities from prime to semiprime rings, as well as to some rather different classes of rings, such as matrix rings over any unital ring. As an application, commuting maps, Lie derivations and commutativity preserving maps in such rings are discussed.	usa	M. Dekker.	2002	1.01	Communications in algebra	0.305	0.504

11469339	Automation of LCF material model parameters' identification	Modeling of material behaviour has significant influence on design and optimiyation of mechanical structures and consequently calculation of their lifetime. When using complex constitutive material model that describes elastic-plastic behaviour of the cyclically loaded material and takes into account damage occurrence and accumulation, the process of parameter identification from experimental data is very complex and time-consuming. In this paper the damage occurrence and accumulation within the material are described by means of models of Bauschinger effect, kinematic and isotropic hardening (or softening) according to Chaboche material model and mean stress relaxation according to Ohno-Wang material model. Since the material model is highly non-linear, its parameter identification requires complex numerical procedures, carefully chosen algorithms and numerical operators, followed by software solution development. The developed automated system for material model parameter identification is validated by comparing the calculated with experimental response of the material. Its usage can make material behaviour modeling for numerous materials accurate, fast and user-friendly.	nld	Elsevier	2010	1.01	Computational materials science	1.458	2.13
11473174	Primjena faktorske analize u istraivanju uèinkovitosti lakaze za obezbojenje i razgradljivost sulfonskih reaktivnih bojila	The influence of oxidoreductase (laccase) and mediator (ABTS) quantities on decolouration and degradation of four vinylsulphone (anthraquinone and azo) reactive dyes after 24 hours of treatment in laccase optimum conditions (pH 5, T = 50 °C) was studied by two-level (min, max) and three-va- riable (X1, X2, X3) experimental design. The factor analysis methodology was used to study the relationship between the factors (process variables) and the responses (process parameters). Four response parameters, i.e. chemical oxygen demand (YCOD), biochemical oxygen demand (YBOD5), toxicity (YHt) and decolouration (YDecol.) of treated dye solutions were assumed to be the most important parameters at identifying the degree of dye degradation and intermediates formed, respectively. The relation of laccase (X1) and ABTS (X2) quantities were the main factors influencing the effectiveness of individual dye bio-transformation (YCOD, YBOD5) at defined dye concentration (X3). In con- trast, the degree of toxicity (YHt) was independent on the dye concentration applied (X3), but dependent on the chemical structure of the dye and the relation of the laccase (X1) and ABTS (X2) variables. The process variables showed no influence on the decolouration (YDecol.) confirming the laccase-mediator-substrate specificity. The results of the factor plan analysis showed limited application of the selected model at determining the significance of process variables on the response parameters of dye solutions.	hrv	Hrvatski inenjerski savez tekstilaca	2007	1.01	Tekstil	0.107	0.674

An approximate length of the digital curve is determined by calculating the length of the continuous B-spline curve. In the paper several examples are presented and the calculated lengths are compared to other methods found in the literature. The advantage of the proposed method is in the approximation of the digital curve with the continuous curve rather than with piecewise linear sections used by most other methods.	nld	Kluwer Academic Publishers	2010	1.01	Journal of mathematical imaging and vision	1.244	0.936

Various definitions of terms are used by different authors and organizations, for example, green chemistry, cleaner production, pollution prevention, etc. The importance of this topic has stimulated research into the problems of clarifying ambiguity and classifying terms used in the sustainability field. This paper provides results of the literature survey and summarizes the definitions of the terms, focusing on the environmental engineering field. In some cases, it proposes an improved definition.

11479067	Identification and optimization of key process parameters in noncontact laser scanning for reverse engineering	This Extended Technical Note shows that the final accuracy level of reverse engineered surfaces depends on scanning distance and scanning angle of the laser beam, hence it also depends on the morphology of the scanned objects. On scanning strongly curved objects, such as the ones with free form surfaces, the distance and impact angle of the laser beam are changing continuously during the scanning process. On the basis of these, two critical parameters are specified for the design model, which make it possible to predict these two factors in advance, depending on the morphology of the scanned object. First, a mathematical-statistical design model of the scanning process is generated, which relies on ANOVA (analysis of variance) and DOE (design of experiments). In the next step, a fitness function is optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) program. This optimization improves the accuracy of the final scanned surfaces, in terms of the minimum standard deviation values of reverse engineered 3D surface model. The proposed approach was confirmed in a case study, which is presented at the end of this Technical Note.	gbr	IPC Science and Technology Press	2010	1.01	Computer Aided Design	1.542	1.167
11479318	Optimization of a gas turbine in the methanol process, using the NLP model	Heat and power integration can reduce fuel usage, CO2 and SO2 emissions and, thereby, pollution. In the simultaneous heat and power integration approach and including additional production, the optimization problem is formulated using a simplified process superstructure. Nonlinear programming (NLP) contains equations which enable structural heat and power integration and parametric optimization. In the present work, the NLP model is formulated as an optimum energy target of process integration and electricity generation using a gas turbine with a separator. The reactor acts as a combustion chamber of the gas turbine plant, producing high temperature. The simultaneous NLP approach can account for capital cost, integration of combined heat and power, process modification, and additional production trade-offs accurately, and can thus yield a better solution. It gives better results than non-simultaneous methods. The NLP model does not guarantee a global cost optimum, but it does lead to good, perhaps near optimum designs. This approach is illustrated by an existing, complex methanol production process. The objective function generates a possible increase in annual profit of 1.7 M EUR/a.	gbr	Elsevier Science	2007	1.01	Applied Thermal Engineering	0.868	0.706

11481366	2,4,6-trichlorophenyl acrylate emulsion-templated porous polymers (PolyHIPEs)	A series of monolithic crosslinked polymers with 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl acrylate as a reactive component was prepared by free radical polymerization of the internal phases of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs). The volume ratio of water to oil phase (void volume; 60-90%), crosslinker type (divinylbenzene or ethylenglycol dimethacrylate) and quantity (30-50 mol %) and type of porogenic solvent (chlorobenzene, toluene, chloroform, dichloroethane) were altered to study these effects on the structure and reactivity of the monolithic polymers. The polymer supports were characterizedby scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry. SEM images revealed an open cellular structure with voids between 1 and 12 ?$/mu$?m and window sizes between 0.3 and 3 ?$/mu$?m. The porogen had an influence on the surface area, being larger with added porogen and the influence being highest with toluene. Addingtoluene also influenced the void size, increasing the average diameter from 2 ?$/mu$?m (no porogen) to 12 ?$/mu$?m (added toluene). Monolithic supports were functionalized by reaction of the ester moieties with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine derivative and by hydrolysis of the ester groups to carboxylic acids.	usa	Wiley	2007	1.01	Journal of polymer science	3.529	1.528

11485211	A level set method coupled with a volume of fluid method for modeling of gas-liquid interface in bubbly flow	This paper describes the implementation of a 3D parallel and Cartesian level set (LS) method coupled with a volume of fluid (VOF) method into the commercial CFD code FLUENT for modeling the gas-liquid interface in bubbly flow. Both level set and volume of fluid methods belong to the so called one fluid methods, where a single set of conservation equations is solved and the interface is captured via a scalar function. Since both LS and VOF have advantages and disadvantages, our aim is to couple these two methods to obtain a method, which is superior to both standalone LS and VOF and verify it versus a selection of test cases. VOF is already available in FLUENT, so we implemented an LS method into FLUENT via user defined functions. The level set function is used to compute the surface tension contribution to the momentum equations, via curvature and its normal to the interface, using the Brackbill method while the volume of fluid function is used to capture the interface itself. A re-initialization equation is implemented and solved at every time step using a fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory schemefor the spatial derivative, and a first-order Euler method for time integration. The coupling effect is introduced by solving at the end of each time step an equation, which connects the volume fractions with the level set function. The verification of parasitic currents and interfacial deformation due to numerical error is assessed in comparison to original VOF scheme. Validation is presented for free rising bubbles of different diameters for Morton numbers ranging from 102 to 10-11.	usa	American Society of Mechanical Engineers	2010	1.01	Journal of fluids engineering	0.440	0.909

11487065	Modeling of amorphous solids by polyclustering technique	The paper presents certain aspects of theoretical modeling of amorphous solids at least some degree of local order. The local short-range order versus the long-range disorder of amorphous structure is described in terms of Voronoi polyhedra, so that the resulting topological tessellations form groups of polyclusters. Consequently, the polyclusters can be considered as individual elements of micromorphic continua. Master equations of micromorphic continua are then perceived as a fundamental set of field equations that are needed for further theoretical development of the model. The semi-discrete nature of field variables describing the kinematics of deformation in polyclusters leads to the natural choice of a pair potential function for modeling a short-range order. Finally, the problem of consistent transmition from micro to macro scale is addressed together with the question of a proper choice of a spatial averaging technique.	fra	Ed. de physique	2001	1.01	Journal de physique	0.401	1.515
11487321	Phenomenological modeling of shape memory effect using the concept of orientational back stress	A derivation of constitutive equations in a general three-dimensional setting is described, based on an additive decomposition of the rate of deformation tensor. The rate of deformation tensor is assumed to consist of an elastic part, a thermoelastic part, a plastic part, and a part due to phase transitions. The thermoelastic part due to thermoelastic coupling accounts for the influence of temperature near phase transformation, while the plastic part is taken in the form of classical flow theory of plasticity with combined isotropic and kinematic hardening, where the back stress represents a tensor of orientational microstresses. It is assumed that the part due to the phase transformation depends on the first of the second invariant of the tensor of crystallographic distortion, on the deviatoric part of the stress tensor, and on a special evolution parameter describing the rate of forming of a new phase. The derived constitutive equation is given in an explicit form with the corresponding tensor generators on the representation together with the irreducible integrity basis of the relevant tensor functions.	fra	Ed. de physique	2001	1.01	Journal de physique	0.401	1.515

1149247	Conservative treatment of female urinary incontinence with functional magnetic stimulation	Objectives. To determine the efficacy and safety of functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) produced by the Pulsegen device compared with placebo in the treatment of women with urinary incontinence. Methods. Fifty-five women with urinary incontinence were randomly assigned to the active FMS group (30 patients) or the placebo group (22 patients). Each patient in the active group received a Pulsegen device, which produced a pulsating magnetic field of B = 10 micro T intensity and a frequency of 10 Hz. Patients were asked to wear the Pulsegen device day and night for 2 months. Clinical and urodynamic data were collected before and after FMS and analyzed using nonparametric statistics. Results. Compared with the placebo, the number of pads used was significantly lower (P = 0.0031) after FMS, as was the pad weight (P = 0.014). In patients from the active group, a significant improvement in the power of the pelvic floor muscle contractions (P = 0.0071), as well as in the duration of the pelvic floor muscle contractions (P = 0.038), was observed. After FMS, a 56.3% improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms was reported by patients in the active group, a significantly greater difference (P = 0.00012) compared with the reported 26.3% improvement in symptoms in the placebo group. Conclusions. We believe that FMS represents a new method in the conservative treatment of urinary incontinence. Magnetic stimulation with the Pulsegen device is efficient and safe. It can be used at home and, because of its small size, wearing the device is not annoying for patients.	usa	Cahners Pub. Co., etc.	2003	1.01	Urology	2.782	1.707
11498201	Rapid regulated dense-core vesicle exocytosis requires the CAPS protein	Although many proteins essential for regulated neurotransmitter and peptide hormone secretion have been identified, little is understood about their precise roles at specific stages of the multistep pathway of exocytosis. To study the function of CAPS (Ca2+ -dependent activator protein for secretion), a protein required for Ca2+ -dependent exocytosis of dense-core vesicles, secretory responses in single rat melanotrophs were monitored by patch-clamp membrane capacitance measurements. Flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ elicited biphasic capacitance increases consisting of rapid and slow components with distinct Ca2+ dependencies. A threshold of è10 microM Ca2+ was required to trigger the slow component, while the rapid capacitance increase was recorded already at a intracellular Ca2+ activity < 10 microM. Both kinetic membrane capacitance components were abolished by botulinum neurotoxin B or E treatment, suggesting involvement of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor attachment protein receptor)-dependent vesicle fusion. The rapid but not the slow component was inhibited by CAPS antibody. These results were further clarified by immunocytochemical studies that revealed that CAPS was present on only a subset of dense-core vesicles. Overall, the results indicate that dense-core vesicle exocytosis in melanotrophs occurs by two parallel pathways. The faster pathway exhibits highsensitivity to Ca2+ and requires the presence of CAPS, which appears to act at a late stage in the secretory pathway.	usa	National Academy of Sciences	2000	1.01	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	10.789	1.74
1150015	Measurement of simple reaction time in antipsychotic treatment of patients with schizophrenia	Background: The role of simple reaction time in schizophrenia has been extensively reported to date in professional literature. However, most studies have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single measurement. The aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia. Methods: Seventeen in-patients suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria) and twenty matched, healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. The patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4 mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at afixed dosage in the first week and thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. Since no differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpson Angus Scaleand Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Reaction time was measured with the Alpha apparatus, connected to a personal computer. All assessments and measurements were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study. Results: The reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). After eight weeks of treatment the reaction time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). Furthermore, the improved reaction time in the patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or with improved extrapyramidal symptoms. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that simple reaction time can improve during treatment with atypical antipsychotics.	aut	Springer	2003	1.01	Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift	0.774	2.111

11502870	The calculation of thermal conductivity, viscosity and thermodynamic properties for nanofluids on the basis of statistical nanomechanics	The paper features the mathematical model of calculation of thermophysical properties for nanofluids on the basis of statistical nanomechanics. Calculation of properties for nanofluids for real substances is possible by the classical and statistical mechanics. Classical mechanics has no insight into the microstructure of the substance. Statistical mechanics, on the other hand, calculates the properties of state on the basis of molecular motions in a space, and on the basis of the intermolecular interactions. The equations obtained by means of classical thermomechanics are empirical and apply only in the region under observation. The main drawback of classical thermomechanicsis that it lacks the insight into the substance of microstructure. Contrary to classical mechanics, statistical mechanics calculates the thermomechanic properties of state on the basis of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions between particles in the same system of molecules. It deals with the systems composed of a very large number of particles. The results of the analysis are compared with experimental data and show a relatively good agreement. The analytical results obtained by statistical mechanics are compared with the experimental data and show relatively good agreement.	gbr	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	International journal of heat and mass transfer	1.500	0.706
11504411	The evolution of effective elastic properties of a cold formed stainless steel sheet	In accordance with the great importance given to the subject of stiffness degradation, in particular with regard to metal forming, this work experimentally investigates the anisotropic elastic properties of plastically prestrained cold-rolled sheet metal (stainless steel EN 1.4301, also AISI 304). From the experiments performed, two main conclusions regarding stiffness degradation can be extracted. First, since under specific stretching the intensity of the normalized Youngs moduli degradation in both directions remains approximately similar, it may be concluded that the potential initial elastic anisotropy tends to be preserved during loading. Second, as the evidenced stiffness degradation has proved to be strongly correlated with the stretching direction of the sheet metal, it can be concluded that the stiffness evolution in the cold rolled sheet steel is path dependent. These interesting discoveries also provide some answers for modelling the kinetic damage evolution laws in damage mechanics.	gbr	Society for Experimental Stress Analysis.	2010	1.01	Experimental mechanics	1.854	0.911

Methods:Clinical features and laboratory results of four patients with acute HGE (established by the presence of the specific DNA sequences of the HGE agent in whole blood by polymerase chain reaction and/or by seroconversion to the HGE agent by indirect immunofluorescence assay) and 12 patients with the initial phase of TBE (demonstrated by the presence of serum IgM antibodies to TBE virus) were compared. All these patients were uncovered at the Department of Infectious Diseases, University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia, during1995-1996, in a prospective study on the aetiology of febrile illnesses occurring within 6 weeks after a tick bite. Results: Findings were similar forthe majority of the examined parameters including severity of illness, level and duration of fever, presence of headache, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver-function test abnormalities. Statistically significant differences were found only for arthralgia (P=0.026) and elevated concentration of C-reactive protein (P=0.003); both variables were found more often in patients with acute HGE. Conclusion: In a patient residing in the central part of Slovenia, who reports a tick bite followed by a febrile illness with leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia, the presence of arthralgias and/or an elevated C-reactive protein value directs toward the diagnosis of acute HGE and against the initial phase of TBE.	gbr	Academic Press	2000	1.01	The Journal of infection	1.188	2.159
11512025	Morphology of FRTL-5 cell colonies in a semi-solid medium	For the first time, 3.7 and 10 days growth of normal thyroid follicular FRTL-5cell colonies in a semi-solid medium of 0.6% methocel over 1% agar base was morphometrically analyzed. It was found that the areas of FRTL-5 colonies as well as their perimeters and maximum diameters increased, while according to their form factors the FRTL-5 colonies were regular in shape. After 10 daysin a semi-solid medium, 83% of the FRTL-5 colonies had maximum diameters greater than 50 um. It is obvious that after long culturing of FRTL-5 cells under the influence of the pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) these cells are not uniform anymore and that they grow in a semi-solid medium.	gbr	Editrice Kurtis	2000	1.01	Journal of endocrinological investigation	1.398	2.51
11512091	A machine-vision system for automated quality control of welded rings	In this paper we describe the development and application of an intelligent measuring control system with integrated robot vision, to enable the solving of complex assembly and quality control tasks with high accuracy and speed. The existing quality-control procedure for welded rings involves a visual observation of the inner surface of the welded ring and the use of calipers. As explained in Section Determination of the control goals, this leads to limitation of the ring accuracy and the ability to detect faults. To overcome these limitations we have developed a noncontact control method implemented inthe machine-vision system. The development and application of machine-visionis a multifold problem. It requires a great amount of expert knowledge, experience and innovation. We present a machine-vision system consisting of a mathematical algorithm developed for accurate measurement of the diameter and roundness of welded rings, to be used along with physical measurements. The principle of the measuring method and the required equipment are given in Section Main idea of the measurement. Section Theoretical description of the algorithm contains themathematical formulation implemented in a computer algorithm for the measured parameters. Section Algorithm verification and the necessary corrections describes analytical experiments conducted to verify the accuracy of the algorithm and derive necessary corrections. Three systems with different range of quality and accuracy are compared and discussed at the end of the paper. The developed machine-vision measuring system was successfully implemented in industrial application, thus eliminating human subjectivity.	usa	Springer	2011	1.01	Machine vision and applications	1.009	1.153
11512281	Role of third intracellular loop of galanin receptor type 1 in signal transdution	To determine the domains essential for G-protein coupling of the human galaninreceptor type 1 (GalR1), we have used both GalR1 mutants and synthetic receptor-derived peptides in 125I-galanin and (35S)-GTPyS binding studies. Replacement of potential phosphorylation sites by Leu in the third intracellular loop (IC3) of GalR1 did not affect KD values for the receptor. Peptides derived form the IC3 loop, and especially the N-terminal part of it were able to increase the rate of (35S)-GTPyS binding to the trimeric Gia1By2,but not to GsAB1y2, whereas the peptides corresponding to the IC1 and IC2 loops had no such effect. IC3 loop peptides also inhibited the binding of 125I-galanin to GalR1 in membranes from Rin m5F cells. Our results suggest that the IC3 loop of GalR1, especially its N-terminal part, defines the coupling of the receptor to the Gia1By2 protein and consequently, to the signal transduction cascade.	gbr	Churchill Livingstone	2000	1.01	Neuropeptides	1.413	2.536
11512793	Anal sphincter electromyography after vaginal delivery	The study was performed to evaluate the potential role of vaginal delivery on innervation of the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle. Forty-four women, 18 nulliparous and 26 of varying parity (1-4), without genitourinary prolapse, major urogynecological, anorectal, or neurological dysfunction were included. Participants histories were evaluated by a questionnaire. Quantitative concentric needle electromyography (EMG) using multi-MUP analysis for samplingmonitor unit potentials (MUPs) an all volunteers, and ""turn/amplitude""analysis for interference pattern (IP) analysis in 13 nulliparous and 23 parous women were applied. Pools of MUPs and IPs of parous and nulliparous women were formed and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple linear regression analysis was used for evaluation of parity and obstetric variables. No difference between the groups was found in any MUP parameter, while a significant difference was found in two of five IP parameters. On multiple linear regression analysis, the number of deliveries was related to several MUP and IP parameters: the time elapsed since last delivery to MUP, and slight stress urinary incontinence to IP parameters. A group of parous women with (slight) stress incontinence had less ""pathologic"" MUP parameters, compared to those without. Vaginal delivery is indeed related to EAS muscle EMG abnormalities. However, these are minor and seem not to indicate loss of sphincter function. Our study casts some doubt on the commonly accepted preconception that significant damage to peripheral innervation of the EAS occurs even during uncomplicated deliveries.	usa	Allen R.

Evidence of Puumala infection was restricted to Clethrionomys glareolus. Although the serotype wasnot determined, antibodies against hantavirus were also found in eight Apodemus sylvaticus. In fall 1996, the seroprevalence in C. glareolus was high(20.1%, 37 of 184) and the infection was widely distributed in the area studied whereas a focal occurrence of positive rodents and lower seroprevalence rates were recorded in spring 1997 (14.3%, six of 42), fall 1997 (6.6%, 11 of 166), spring 1998 (6.4%, three of 47) and fall 1998 (6.7%, 11 of 165). A pullulation of rodents was observed in spring 1999 and was associated with a markedly higher seroprevalence in C. glareolus (47.7%, 189 of 396). In all seasons, infection rates in adults were higher than in juveniles and subadults. No significant difference of prevalence was recorder between males and females. In two trapping sites, the temporary disappearance of positive animals after a crach in rodent populations suggests that a threshold in density is necessary for the maintenance of the enzootic cycle.	nld	Elsevier	2000	1.01	Virus Research	1.561	2.481
11514073	Morphometry of the FRTL-5 cells after irradiation	The morphological changes of in vitro irradiated FRTL-5 cells and their ability to grow in semi-solid medium were studied morphometrically. FRTL-5 cells were grown in medium with 4 different concentrations of TSH (0, 0.1, 1, 10 mU/ml). After irradiation with 0 Gy, 2 Gy and 4 Gy, the cells were seeded on glass cover-slips and in methocel. Fourteen days after irradiation, the morphometric analysis of FRTL-5 cells and their nuclei was performed. The results showed that irradiation and different doses of TSH have influence on FRTL-5 cell size, more on their nuclei than on the cell as a whole. Growing ofFRTL-5 cells in the methocel indicates the possible transformation of these cells after long-culturing in the TSH medium and after irradiation.	hun	Akadémiai Kiadó	2000	1.01	Acta biologica Hungarica	0.291	1.778
1151591	Deformation characteristics of lacustrine carbonate silt in Julian Alps	The deformation characteristics, shear moduli and damping ratios of reconstituted lacustrine carbonate silt samples were investigated in a different kinds of laboratory test. Material from a landslide that occurred in a seismically very active area in Slovenia was used in the test. The initial values of this material`s deformation characteristics and the extent to which these values change due to increasing shear strain depend on a number of factors, such as the degree of saturation, the initial void ratio, over-consolidation, and the effective stresses. The use of a volumetric threshold strain has proved to be the best way of describing the shear modulus reduction curve irrespective of any other factors, and it fits well with the data obtained in the experiments. The critical state and consolidation lines for the investigated material are presented in the paper as deformational characteristics at critical strain levels. The material`s liquefaction potential was studied for certain in situ conditions.	gbr	CML Publications	2006	1.01	Soil dynamics and earthquake engineering	0.760	0.683
11515931	Influence of texturing parameters and contact conditions on tribological behaviour of laser textured surfaces	Introducing specific textures on a tribological surface can contribute to friction reduction in sliding contacts. Well defined micro-dimples can act as lubricant reservoirs capable of feeding lubricant directly into the contact and initiating micro elastohydrodynamic lubrication, as well as traps for wearde bris. A lot of experimental work has been already carried out, but it is mostly based on trial and error approach when defining optimum textures for a given application. A comparison was made between the performance of a reference non-textured surface and laser surface texturing (LST) discs with three different dimple depths. It was found that tribological behaviour depends on the depth of the micro-dimples as well as on the dominant lubrication mode (operating conditions). The beneficial effect of micro-dimples becomes larger with an increase in dimple depth as well as for higher sliding speeds.	ita	Tamburini Editore SpA	2010	1.01	Meccanica	1.056	1.214
1151601	Network structure of cellulose ethers used in pharmaceutical applications during swelling and equilibrium	Purpose. The purpose of this work was to investigate the swelling behavior of four cellulose ethers that differ in their type and degree of substitution andto elucidate the network structure of the swollen matrices under dynamic and equilibrium conditions. Methods. Dynamic vapor sorption was performed to assess the ability of polymer chains and water molecules to interact. Dynamic and equilibrium swelling studies were performed to calculate molecular parameters of swollen polymers using the Flory-Rehner theory. Results. We determined the volume-swelling ratio of the polymer matrices and observed thatit was dependent on their hydrophilicity. We determined molecular parameters that characterize the swollen hydrogels of cellulose derivatives, such as the polymer volume fraction in the swollen state, upsilon(2,S), the effective molecular weight of the polymer chain between physical entanglements, (M) over bar (e), the number of repeating units between two entanglements, u, and the number of entanglements per chain, e. The (M) over bar (e) of the cellulose derivatives studied varied significantly depending onthe type of cellulose ether and on the swelling time. Conclusions. The orderof mesh size, an important parameter for predicting drug diffusion and release, taking into account all determined parameters, isÈ hydroxypropyl cellulose < hydroxyethyl cellulose < hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose K100M < hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose K4M.	nld	Thieme	2002	1.01	Pharmaceutical research	2.354	1.557

1152369	Rutin in buckwheat herbs grown at different UV-B radiation levels: comparison of two UV spectrophotometric and an HPLC method	Rutin is an antioxidant with many interesting pharmacological effects. It can also be found in buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench). UV radiation stimulates the activity of enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and there issome evidence that it influences the rutin content in plants. The aim of thepresent research was (1) to examine the influence of different levels of UV-B radiation on rutin content and (2) to compare the results obtained by three analytical methods. The plants were grown under three UV-B levelsÈ reduced, ambient and enhanced, simulating 17% ozone depletion. Analyses were performed by HPLC and two spectrophotometric methods. In one, the absorbancieswere measured at 420 nm with and without the addition of AlCl3. Inanother method the concentration was calculated from absorbancies at 352.5 nm and 366.5 nm according to the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International. The highest amounts of rutin were found in flowers, followed byleaves and stems. A comparison of the different treatments revealed that thehighest amounts of rutin were in plants grown under ambient radiation, followed by the plants cultivated under enhanced UV-B and then under reduced UV-B radiation. Treatments caused more effect on leaves than on flowers. Leaves developed under ambient light conditions contained 97% more rutin than leaves grown under reduced UV-B radiation. In flowers, the contents differed by 19% only. The results obtained using the three methods showed a good correlation, but the absolute differences were surprisingly high. The AOAC andthe AlCl3 methods gave, on average, 140% and 30% higher results than HPLC, respectively	gbr	Clarendon Press	2002	1.01	Journal of Experimental Botany	2.852	1.444

1152649	Efficacy of CCA and Tanalith E treated pine fence to fungal decay after ten years in service	In response to environmental and health concerns over the use of CCA in wood preservation, there has been an increase in the development and use of arsenic and chromium free copper-based alternatives in recent years. One of the most promising alternatives to CCA is a copper-organic system, like Tanalith E, which is widely used out of the ground and is particularly suitable for wood used in outdoor applications. This is also accompanied by many attempts to understand the mechanism of copper tolerance by wood decay fungi. Samples made from CCA and Tanalith E impregnated fence (pine) palings that had been in service for ten years, were exposed to four different brown rot fungi (Antrodia vaillantii, Leucogyrophana pinastri, Poria monticola and Gloeophyllum trabeum) according to EN 113 procedure. After 16 weeks, the samples were isolated and their mass losses determined. They were also analysed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The CCA and Tanalith E treated wood were found to be resistant against the Cu-sensitive G. trabeum. L. pinastri and P. monticola decayed the Tanalith E but not the CCA treated samples. However, the Cu-tolerant A. vaillantii decayed both the Tanalith E and the CCA treated samples. The EPR spectra of the treated wood before and after exposure to the fungi, have shown the important role of oxalic acid in fungal tolerance of copper.	svk	Slovak Forest Products Research Institute	2004	1.01	Wood research	0.059	0.492

11529305	Complexity theory for Lie-group solvers	Commencing with a brief survey of Lie-group theory and differential equations evolving on Lie groups, we describe a number of numerical algorithms designed to respect Lie-group structure: Runge-Kutta-Munthe-Kaas schemes, Fer and Magnus expansions. This is followed by derivation of the computational cost of Fer and Magnus expansions, whose conclusion is that for order four, six, and eight an appropriately diskretized Magnus method is always cheaper then a Fer method of the same order. Each Lie-group method of the kind surveyed in yhis paper requires the computation of a matrix exponential. Classical methods, e.g. Krylov-subspace and rational approximants, may fail to map elements in a Lie algebra to a Lie group. Therefore, we survey a number of approximants based on the splitting approach and demonstrate that their cost is compatible (and often superior) to classical methods.	usa	Academic Press	2002	1.01	Journal of complexity	0.892	0.679
11533785	The structure and function of songs emitted by southern green stink bugs from Brazil, Florida, Italy and Slovenia	Nezara viridula (L.) (Pentatomidae: Heteroptera) from Brazil, Florida. Italy and Slovenia, communicate by vibratory songs associated with long-range calling and close-range courting, rivalry and repelling. Each song is composedof spectrally and temporally different units. Spectrally different pulses of duration less than 300ms are present in the male calling song. The female calling song is characterized by pulse trains composed of pulses shorter than 150 ms and pulse trains composed of a longer (> 700 ms) and shorter (< 250 ms) pulse. Shorter and longer pulses have different spectral characteristics. The male and female courtship songs are characterized by fusion of shorter (< 150 ms) pulses into a pulse train usually followed by a shorter (< 200 ms) postpulse in the case of the male courtship song. The female repelling song is a several seconds long vibration of irregular temporal structure. The short (< 400 ms) male rival song pulses are frequency modulated. The dominant frequency peaks of the songs investigated lie between 70 and 130 Hz. The dominant frequency and the microstructure of song spectra show no population specificity. The average duration varies more in calling than in courtship songs. The repetition time varies extensively in songs of different populations. Normal communication followed by copulation was observed between mates from Slovenia and Brazil and between mates from Floridaand Italy. The potential role of different temporal and spectral parameters for species recognition and mate location is discussed in view of the expected distortion of the characteristic signal structure during transmission through plants.	gbr	Blackwell Scientific Publications	2000	1.01	Physiological entomology	0.853	0.794

Therefore, two sets of oligonucleotides were designed and with both of them fragments of the expectedsize were obtained. The sequence of the fragment derived from kinetoplast DNA corresponds to the Leishmania Viannia complex. Polymerase chain reaction has advantages over classical diagnostic methods, which makes it an important technique in those hospitals and clinical laboratories in Europe which lack standard diagnostic tests for Leishmania.	deu	MMV-Medizin-Verlag	2000	1.01	Infection	1.254	2.159

The grapheme-to-phoneme conversion engine is flexible, efficient, and appropriate for multilingual text-to-speech systems. The grapheme-to-phoneme conversion process is described via finite-state machine formalism. The engine developed for Slovenian language can be integrated into various applications but can be even more efficiently integrated into architectures based on finite-state machine formalisms.

The method is extended into 3D, where the approximation of spherical surface is developed based on surface-intersecting facets. Finally, a method is described for approximating the general curved surface. Theoretical analysis and the experimental results showed that the new algorithm requires considerably less geometric data at the same approximation error than the traditional one.	gbr	Elsevier Applied Science	2008	1.01	Advances in engineering software	1.188	1.281

Equilibrium solubilities of vanillins in compressed fluorinated hydrocarbons were determined at temperatures 313.2 and 333.2 K and over a pressure range between 1.1 and 26.0 MPa with a static-analytic method. Experimental solubility data were correlated by a density-based Chrastil model. Results showed that phase equilibria of vanillins in investigated compressed gases are influenced by the type of alchoxy group (methoxy or ethoxy) and the position of OH group (ortho or para), bound to the aromatic ring of solute, as well as the molecular structure of the gas. Three phase SLG curves in p,T-projections mainly exhibited temperature minimums and negative slopes dp/dT, with a maximum melting point depression between 9 and 21 K; all systems with SF6 exhibited a continuous positive slope dp/dT of approximately 4.5 MPa/K. SLG curves with a temperature maximum at low pressure were observed for systems of o-vanillins with R23. Solubilities of o-vanillins in R23 and R236fa were higher in comparison with p-vanillins, whereas, in the case of R134a, the solubilities were influenced by the alchoxy group bound on aromatic ring: vanillin and o-vanillin with methoxy group are more soluble than vanillins with ethoxy group (ethylvanillin and o-ethylvanillin). The highest solubility of all four vanillins was observed in R236fa.	nld	PRA Press	2007	1.01	The Journal of supercritical fluids	2.189	1.015

A Fuzzy Logic Model, based on fuzzy set theory, was constructed for this purpose, in order to compare the performances of sugar plants within the sector's best standards, as expressed in the Reference Document on BAT. The effectiveness of the model was tested in the case study,in which three sugar plants were benchmarked against the BAT regarding the consumption of energy, water, raw materials and the production of wastes, wastewater, by-products and the main product. The model was recognized as helpful for the benchmarking needs of sugar plants. In addition, by integrating BAT Reference Document analysis into the model, it provides IPPC permitting authorities with an objective method and uniform BAT benchmarks to manage permitting process.	nld	Elsevier;Pergamon	2007	1.01	Resources, conservation and recycling	1.270	1.376

11552534	Implementation of non-intrusive fault detection in embedded control systems	Paper presents fault detection in embedded control systems by the so-called monitoring cells. The basic idea is to monitor input/output variables and internal states of systems, processes or sub-processes by using acquired and built-in knowledge about the normal behavior in order to detect abnormalities. Paper gives the detailed architecture and the operation of the monitoring cells. The concept is applicable even if only a limited knowledge about the control system is available. In such cases the proposed automated learning of the monitoring function can be used. In the second part, two different implementations of the monitoring celi are presented. The first one uses discrete analogue devices and a field programmable gate array. The secondis based on the programmable system-on-a-chip devices.	svn	Strokovno drutvo za mikroelektroniko, elektronske sestavne dele in materiale	2007	1.01	Informacije MIDEM	0.117	0.927
11554331	Fast ellipsometric measurements based on a single crystal photo-elastic modulator	For quality control in high volume manufacturing of thin layers and for tracking of physical and chemical processes, ellipsometry is a common measurement technology. For such kinds of applications we present a novel approach of fast ellipsometric measurements. Instead of a conventional setup that uses a standard photo-elastic modulator, we use a 92 kHy Single Crystal Photo-Elastic Modulator (SCPEM), which is a LiTaO3 crystal with a size of 28 *9 * 4 mm. This small, simple, and cost-effective solution also offers the advantage of direct control of the retardation via the current amplitude, which is important for repeatability of the measurements. Instead of a Lock-InAmplifier, an automated digital processing based on a fast analog to digital converter controlled by a highly flexible Field Programmable Gate Array is used. This and the extremely compact and efficient polarization modulation allow fast ellipsometric testing where the upper limit of measurement rates is mainly limited by the desired accuracy and repeatability of the measurements. The standard deviation that is related to the repeatability +/-0.002° for dielectric layers can be easily reached.	usa	Optical Society of America	2010	1.01	Optics express	3.749	1.753

11573526	Optimiranje znaèilnih parametrov frezanja z uporabo razvojne tehnike optimizacije jate delcev	The selection of machining parameters is an important step in process planning; therefore, a new evolutionary computation technique has been developed to optimize the machining process. In this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to efficiently optimize the machining parameters simultaneously in milling processes where multiple conflicting objectives are present. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) predictive model is used topredict the cutting forces during machining and then the PSO algorithm is used to obtain the optimum cutting speeds and feed rates. The goal of the optimization is to determine the objective function maximum (the predicted cutting-force surface) by considering the cutting constraints. During optimization the particles 'fly' intelligently in the solution space and search for optimal cutting conditions according to the strategies of the PSO algorithm. The results showed that an integrated system of neural networks and swarm intelligence is an effective method for solving multi-objective optimization problems. The high accuracy of the results within a wide range of machining parameters indicates that the system can be practically applied in industry. The simulation results show that compared with genetic algorithms (GAs) and simulated annealing (SA) the proposed algorithm can improve the quality of the solution while speeding up the convergence process. The new computational technique has several advantages and benefits and is suitable for use when combined with ANN-based models where no explicit relation between the inputs and the outputs is available. This research opens the door for a new class of optimization techniques that are based on evolution computation in the area of machining.	svn	Zveza strojnih inenirjev in tehnikov Slovenije [et al.] = Association of Mechanical Engineers and Technicians of Slovenia [et al.]	2007	1.01	Strojniki vestnik	0.088	0.706

11576854	Annotating discourse markers in spontaneous speech corpora on an example for the Slovenian	Speech-to-speech translation technology has difficulties processing elements of spontaneity in conversation. We propose a discourse marker attribute in speech corpora to help overcome some of these problems. There have already been some attempts to annotate discourse markers in speech corpora. However, as there is no consistency on what expressions count as discourse markers, we have to reconsider how to set a framework for annotating, and, in order to better understand what we gain by introducing a discourse marker category, we have to analyse their characteristics and functions in discourse. This is especially important for languages such as Slovenian where no or little research on the topic of discourse markers has been carried out. The aims of this paper are to present a scheme for annotating discourse markers based on the analysis of a corpus of telephone conversations in the tourism domain in the Slovenian language, and to give some additional arguments based on the characteristics and functions of discourse markers that confirm their special status in conversation.	nld	Springer	2007	1.01	Language resources and evaluation	0.293	1.122
11577115	Principles of exergy analysis of human heat and mass exchange with the indoor environment	This paper describes the application of exergy analysis to human heat and mass exchange with the indoor environment. The basis for this paper is the existence of a formal similarity between the parameters defining human heat and mass transfer governed by physiological processes and the parameters defining exergy destruction. Basic heat and mass transfer is calculated using a standard two-node human physiological model. To enable an exergy analysis the model was divided according to heat and mass transfer over appropriate boundaries. The exergy analysis was performed for each process with regard to the type of exergy that participates in heat and mass exchange with respect to the indoor environment. The results provide insight into the complex interactions between the human body and environment as characterized by exergy destruction. Furthermore, the analzsis indicates that at given physiological parameters only a certain combination of environmental conditions ensures minimal exergy destruction. These environmental and human conditions coincide with expected level of thermal comfort.	gbr	Pergamon Press.	2010	1.01	International journal of heat and mass transfer	1.898	0.909

11577878	Optimization of markers in clothing industry	The optimization of markers is one of the most important preparatory steps for production in the clothing industry. It determines the sizes of clothes to be laid and cut together. Markers are built on a work order basis. The work order is a matrix of sizes by colors that have to be covered by markers in an optimal way. The optimal way can be defined in a number of ways: it can be the minimum number of markers to accomplish the work order, or the least time for fulfilling the work order, or the minimal amount of cloth used. In this article, the problem of marker optimization is treated formally. The problem is transformed into the 0/1 knapsack problem and solved using evolutionary algorithms. The results obtained on ten real-world work orders show an important improvement over the previously best known solutions.	nld	Pineridge Press	2008	1.01	Engineering applications of artificial intelligence	1.397	1.044
1157993	The international classification of functioning, disability and health	Objective: There has been no attempt to obtain a continuous summary measure of disability from the checklist of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Our objective was to assess whether valid scales of Capacity and Performance could be developed from the ""Activities and Participation"" domain of the ICF checklist. Study Design and Setting: A multicenter, observational study of 1,092 patients with 12 different chronic conditions from five European countries was conducted. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to assess the underlying factor structure. Reliability and validity of the Capacity and Performance scales were evaluated. Construct validity was assessed calculating effect size coefficients between extreme severity groups (discriminant ability). Results: The good fit of the confirmatory factor model supported the global scales of Capacity and Performance and their ""Psychosocial"" and ""Physical"" subscales. Reliability was excellent (coefficients = 0.79-0.92). Effect sizes of most conditions were large for the Capacity global scale (0.50-3.05), and slightly lower for the Performance global scale (0.45-2.57). Conclusions: Our findings support the measurement model, reliability, and validity of the Capacity and Performance scales. Summary measures of functioning based on the ICF can be obtained using these scales, which should facilitate their incorporation in clinical and epidemiological studies.	usa	Pergamon Press	2011	1.01	Journal of Clinical Epidemiology	4.271	1.91

We used the proposed approach in industrial applications with a superior behaviour to the theoretically better solutions. The method efficiently avoids the requirement of initial randomization of the input points by splitting the plane in strips using a heuristic. Points in strips are stored either in (a,b)-skip lists or in (a,b)-trees. Testing of the algorithms at different point distributions shows that our algorithm, using proposed heuristic, is almost insensible to distributions of input points, what makes the algorithm very attractive for various engineering applications.	nld	Pergamon	2008	1.01	Pattern recognition	3.279	1.332

The association of motor and cognitive variables were estimated by multiple regression analysis, which showed positive and significant associations between the latent motor variables and the cognitive variables for both boys and girls. On both sexes, the motor dimensions with the strongest associations with the cognitive abilities are those of coordination and the speed of movement. Despite some differences between boys and girls, they still have a lot in common since the most important latent motor dimensions prevailing in the connection between motor and cognitive dimensions are similar	usa	Perceptual and motor skills	2002	1.01	Perceptual and motor skills	0.258	1.647

11581462	Determination of passive earth pressure using three-dimensional failure mechanism	This paper presents a modified three-dimensional (3D) failure mechanism for determining the 3D passive earth pressure coefficient using the upper bound theorem within the framework of the limit analysis theory. The translational kinematically admissible failure mechanism generalized with a depth of h = 1.0 is considered in the analysis. The mechanism geometry presents a volume of rigid blocks composed of the central body and two lateral rigid bodies, which are connected by a common velocity field. The front surface of the central body interacts with the retaining wall, while the upper surface can be loaded by surcharge loading. The lateral body segments represent four- and three-sided polygons in the cross section of the central body; therefore, they define the polygonal failure surface of the central part. At the outer side, each segment of the lateral body is bounded by infinitesimally spaced rigid half-cones that describe the envelope of a family of half-cones. The numerical results of 3D passive earth pressure limit values are presented by non-dimensional coefficients of passive earth pressure influenced by the soil weight Kpg and a coefficient of passive earth pressure influenced by the surcharge Kpq. This research was intended to improve the lowest values obtained until now using the limit analysis theory. The results are presentedin a graphical form depending on the geometrical parameters and soil properties. A brief description of two world-recognized failure mechanisms based on the limit analysis approach, and the comparison of three failure mechanism results are also presented.	svn	Fakulteta za gradbenitvo	2007	1.01	Acta geotechnica Slovenica	0.235	1.03
11581974	Comparison of virtual crack extension and strain energy density methods applied to contact surface crack growth	The paper is concerned with comparison of two crack propagation methods applied to a two-dimensional computational model of the surface initiated crack growth in the lubricated contact area of meshing gears. The virtual crack extension method and the minimum strain energy density criterion are used for simulation of the crack propagation in the framework of the finite element analysis. The discretised equivalent contact model, with the assumed size and orientation of the initial crack, is subjected to contact loading conditions, accounting for the elasto-hydro-dynamic lubrication effects, tangential loading due to sliding and the influence of lubricating fluid, driven into the crack by hydraulic mechanism. The computational results show that both crack propagation methods give comparable results, although the virtual crack extension method has some clear advantages due to its theoretical superiority in dealing with mixed-mode short crack propagation close to the loading boundary.	nld	Pergamon Press.	2007	1.01	Engineering fracture mechanics	1.227	1.049
11582230	Implementing sustainable laundering procedures for textiles in a commercial laundry and thus decreasing wastewater burden	This paper presents a research on how to optimize a laundering program to reduce wastewater burden thus achieving a more sustainable laundering procedure. A green surgical textiles program was investigated and the first step of optimization was performed based on the results of measuring certain parameters in the water taken from individual chambers. The wastewater parameters were reduced after optimization of the program although effluent treatment plants for water reuse remain necessary. An experimental laundering procedure with a high dosage of sodium hypochlorite was also conducted in order to observe a correlation between measured values of active chlorine and conductivity. As an approximate correlation was found this could result in thepossibility of incorporating a sensor in the washing machine measuring online the conductivity with the possibility of regulating the dosage of sodium hypochlorite and thus preventing overdosing, which increases the damages of the laundered textiles and the burden of wastewater.	gbr	Elsevier	2008	1.01	Journal of cleaner production	1.362	1.484

Samples of material with martensitic microstructure were prepared by adequate thermal treatment. Microstructurally small Vickers indentations were used as an artificial micro defect. The compressive residual stresses are due to the irreversibility of plastic deformation. The moment of indenting enables to prepare samples with and without effects of residual stresses. The stress level for crack initiation depends on the actual indentation size. The location of initiated cracks is affected by the presence and character of residual stresses.	hrv	Metalurki fakultet;Hrvatsko metalurko drutvo	2007	1.01	Metalurgija	0.196	0.661

A cytophotometrical study	Cytophotometrical measurements of enzyme activities were performed in the myocardium and skeletal muscle fibres from normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters(BIO 8262) during ageing from 12-14 to 120-190 days. Myocardium as well as vastus lateralis muscles of cardiomyopathic hamsters showed changes inenzyme activities. The skeletal muscle fibres were typed into slow-oxidative, fast-oxidative glycolytic and fast-glycolytic to investigate fibre type-related changes in muscles of cardiomyopathic hamsters. The following myopathic changes were mainly found: Myofibrillic ATPase was depressed in the myocardium of both ventricles in all investigated age stages.The ATPase activity of the right ventricle was more decreased than thatof the left one. Additionally, a metabolic shift was observed in myocardium and slow oxidative muscle fibres at the onset of clinical symptoms which appeared from day 150 to day 190. During the period from 42 up to 190 days of life an increase of oxidative (succinate dehydrogenase) activity was measured in the myocardium of both ventricles and in slow oxidative fibres of vastus lateralis muscle as a proximal muscle. At earlier ages, the fast fibresof myopathic vastus lateralis muscle showed higher glycolytic (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) activity than those of normal muscles. However, at the age of 120-190 days the metabolic profile of fast fibres was normalized. In gastrocnemius muscle as a distal muscle no changes of enzyme activities were measured, suggesting the investigated hereditary myopathy effected proximal, but not distal muscles.	deu	Fischer	2000	1.01	Experimental and toxicologic pathology	0.689	1.578

Two hundred and sixty mice of the genus Apodemus, trapped in five natural foci of DOB-associated HFRS during 1990-1996, were screened for the presence of anti-hantavirus antibodies and 49Apodemus flavicollis and four Apodemus agrarius were found to be positive. RT-PCR was used to recover partial sequences of the wt-DOB medium (M) and small (S) genome segments from nine A. flavicollls and one A. agrarius. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the Slovenian wt-DOB strains revealed dose relatedness of all A. flavicollis-derived virus sequences (nucleotide diversity up to 6% for the M segment and 5% for the S segment) andthe geographical clustering of genetic variants. In contrast, the strain harboured by A. agrarius showed a high level of genetic diversity from other Slovenian DOB strains (14%) and dustered together on phylogenetic trees with other DOB strains harboured by A. agrarius from Russia, Estonia and Slovakia. These findings suggest that the DOB variants carried by the two species of Apodemus in Europe represent two distinct genetic lineages.	gbr	Cambridge University Press	2000	1.01	Journal of General Virology	3.126	1.547
